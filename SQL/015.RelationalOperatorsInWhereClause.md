Relational operators in SQL are used to compare two values and return results based on the comparison. These operators are primarily used in the WHERE clause of an SQL query to filter data based on specific conditions.

#### Here are the common relational operators in SQL:

- Equal to (=): Checks if the values of two operands are equal.

- Not equal to (!= or <>): Checks if the values of two operands are not equal.

- Greater than (>): Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the right operand.

- Less than (<): Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the right operand.

- Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

- Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

1. Equal To (=): Find all employees with a salary of exactly 2600.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY = 2600;
```
This query retrieves all employees who earn exactly 2600.

2. Not Equal To (!=): Find all employees whose salary is not 2600.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY <> 2600;
```
This query retrieves employees whose salary is not equal to 2600, showcasing how you can filter out specific values.

3. Greater Than (>): Find employees with a salary greater than 10000.
```sql
Copy code
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY > 10000;
```
This query selects employees with a salary greater than 10000, typically senior employees or managers.

4. Less Than (<): Find employees with a salary less than 3000.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY < 3000;
```
This query retrieves all employees earning less than 3000, likely showing entry-level employees.

5. Greater Than or Equal To (>=): Find employees hired on or after '01-JAN-06'.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, HIRE_DATE
FROM emp_details
WHERE HIRE_DATE >= '01-JAN-06';
```
This query helps in finding employees who joined after a specific date, useful for HR analytics.

6. Less Than or Equal To (<=): Find employees with a salary less than or equal to 5000.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY <= 5000;
```
This query shows employees earning 5000 or below, giving insights into lower-paid roles.

7. Combining Operators: Find employees with a salary between 5000 and 10000.
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY >= 5000 AND SALARY <= 10000;
```
This query selects employees with salaries between 5000 and 10000, a common use case to narrow down results within a range.
