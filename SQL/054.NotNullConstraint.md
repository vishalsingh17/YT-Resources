# NOT NULL Constraint in MySQL

## Introduction
The `NOT NULL` constraint in MySQL ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value. It is used to enforce that certain fields in a table always have valid data.

---

## Why Use `NOT NULL`?
- Ensures data integrity by preventing `NULL` values in critical columns.
- Useful for columns that must always contain a value, such as primary keys, foreign keys, and fields with business-critical information.

---

## Syntax
The `NOT NULL` constraint can be applied during table creation or modification.

### 1. Adding `NOT NULL` During Table Creation
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name data_type NOT NULL,
    other_column data_type
);
```

### 2. Adding `NOT NULL` to an Existing Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY column_name data_type NOT NULL;
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Table with `NOT NULL`
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
);
```
In this example:
- `employee_id`and `first_name` must have values.
- `last_name` can accept `NULL` values.

---

### Example 2: Inserting Data into a Table with `NOT NULL`
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name)
VALUES (1, 'John');
```
This is valid because all `NOT NULL` columns (`employee_id`, `first_name`) have values.

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name)
VALUES ('Jane');
```
This will throw an error because `employee_id` is `NOT NULL` but no value was provided.

---

### Example 3: Adding `NOT NULL` to an Existing Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
MODIFY last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
```
If any existing rows have `NULL` in the `last_name` column, this command will fail. You must first update those rows:
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET last_name = 'Unknown'
WHERE last_name IS NULL;
```

---

### Example 4: Combining `NOT NULL` with Default Values
To avoid errors when inserting data, combine `NOT NULL` with a default value:
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    customer_id INT
);
```
In this example:
- `order_date` will automatically take the current date if no value is provided.

---

### Example 5: Checking for `NOT NULL` Columns
To find columns that are `NOT NULL` in a table:
```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM employees;
```
This will display the table schema, including whether a column is `NULL` or `NOT NULL`.

---

## Key Points
1. The `NOT NULL` constraint enforces that a column must always have a value.
2. It is commonly used for primary keys, foreign keys, and critical data fields.
3. When adding `NOT NULL` to an existing table, ensure no existing rows contain `NULL` values.
4. Combining `NOT NULL` with default values can help prevent insertion errors.

---

## Common Errors
1. **Inserting `NULL` into a `NOT NULL` column:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name)
   VALUES (3, NULL);
   ```
   Error: Column 'first_name' cannot be null.

2. **Adding `NOT NULL` to a Column with `NULL` Values:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employees
   MODIFY last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
   ```
   Error: Cannot add a NOT NULL constraint as existing rows contain `NULL` values.

---

## Conclusion
The `NOT NULL` constraint is a fundamental tool in MySQL for ensuring data integrity. By enforcing that critical fields always contain valid data, you can build robust and reliable database applications.
