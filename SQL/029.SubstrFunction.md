# `SUBSTR()` in MySQL

The `SUBSTR()` function in MySQL extracts a substring from a specified string, based on a defined starting position and optional length. This function is beneficial for data extraction from strings stored in a database, making it useful for string manipulation and formatting tasks.

---

## Syntax

```sql
SUBSTR(string, start_position, [length])
```

- `string`: The original string or column from which to extract.
- `start_position`: The position in the string where extraction begins (1-based index).
- `length`: Optional. Defines the number of characters to extract. If omitted, the function will return the substring from the starting position to the end of the string.

## Examples for `emp_details` Table

Assume our table `emp_details` has the following columns:

- `EMPLOYEE_ID`: ID of the employee
- `FIRST_NAME`: First name of the employee
- `LAST_NAME`: Last name of the employee
- `DEPARTMENT`: Department of the employee

### 1. Extracting a First Name Substring

Get the first three letters of each employee's first name.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SUBSTR(FIRST_NAME, 1, 3) AS Name_Prefix
FROM emp_details;
```

This query retrieves a substring starting at the first letter and captures three characters of the `FIRST_NAME` for each employee.

---

### 2. Extracting Last Name from the Middle

Extract the third to the fifth characters from each employee's `LAST_NAME`.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME, SUBSTR(LAST_NAME, 3, 3) AS LastName_Middle
FROM emp_details;
```

Here, `SUBSTR(LAST_NAME, 3, 3)` will start at the third character of `LAST_NAME` and extract the next three characters.

---

### 3. Handling Dynamic Length Substrings

Retrieve all characters of `FIRST_NAME` from the second position to the end of the string.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SUBSTR(FIRST_NAME, 2) AS Name_From_Second
FROM emp_details;
```

In this example, leaving out the length means the function will return all characters from the second position onward.

---

### 4. Combining `SUBSTR()` with `WHERE` Clause

Filter employees whose first names start with "An" by extracting the first two characters and checking the result.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE SUBSTR(FIRST_NAME, 1, 2) = 'An';
```

This query filters employees whose `FIRST_NAME` begins with "An."

---

### 5. Using `SUBSTR()` in the `ORDER BY` Clause

Order employees by the first two characters of their `LAST_NAME`.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
ORDER BY SUBSTR(LAST_NAME, 1, 2);
```

This query sorts the results based on the first two letters of each employee's `LAST_NAME`.

---

### 6. `SUBSTR()` with Calculations

Retrieve the last three characters of each `FIRST_NAME` by calculating the position from the end.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, 
       SUBSTR(FIRST_NAME, LENGTH(FIRST_NAME) - 2, 3) AS Name_End
FROM emp_details;
```

In this case, we use `LENGTH(FIRST_NAME) - 2` to find the starting point for the last three characters.

---

## Key Takeaways

- `SUBSTR()` is versatile for text extraction and works well with other SQL clauses (`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`).
- The `start_position` is 1-based, meaning the count starts from 1.
- Omitting the `length` argument returns the substring from `start_position` to the end of the string.
