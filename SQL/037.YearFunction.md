# MySQL YEAR() Function: 

## 1. Overview of the YEAR() Function
The `YEAR()` function in MySQL extracts the year part from a given date.
The function returns the year as a 4-digit number (e.g., 2024).

### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT YEAR(date_column);
```

## 2. Key Points to Remember
- The input date can be a `DATE`, `DATETIME`, or `TIMESTAMP` data type.
- If the input is `NULL`, the function returns `NULL`.
- Used for filtering, grouping, and extracting year information from date columns.

## 3. Examples Using the emp_details Table
### Example 1: Extract the Year from a Date Column Extract the year from the DOB column for all employees.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, YEAR(DOB) AS birth_year
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Shows the year of birth for each employee.

### Example 2: Find Employees Born in a Specific Year List employees born in 1990.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE YEAR(DOB) = 1990;
```

**Purpose**: Retrieves employees born in the year 1990.

### Example 3: Count Employees Born After 2000

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS born_after_2000
FROM emp_details
WHERE YEAR(DOB) > 2000;
```

**Purpose**: Counts the number of employees born after the year 2000.

### Example 4: Filter Employees by a Range of Years Find employees born between 1985 and 1995.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DOB
FROM emp_details
WHERE YEAR(DOB) BETWEEN 1985 AND 1995;
```

**Purpose**: Lists employees born within the specified range of years.

### Example 5: Extract the Year from a Static Date Extract the year from a fixed date (e.g., 2023-11-09).

```sql
SELECT YEAR('2023-11-09') AS year_extracted;
```

**Purpose**: Demonstrates extracting the year from a specific date literal.

## 4. Common Use Cases
- Date Filtering: Filter data based on the year, such as recent hires or births.
- Reporting: Generate reports grouped by year (e.g., yearly sales, number of new employees).
- Calculations: Calculate durations or check specific years for events.

## 5. Performance Considerations
- When using YEAR() in WHERE clauses, note that this may prevent the use of indexes, impacting query performance. To optimize, consider storing the year as a separate column or use indexed date comparisons.
- Ensure date columns are properly formatted as DATE, DATETIME, or TIMESTAMP for consistent results.
