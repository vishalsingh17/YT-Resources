# MySQL `LIMIT` Keyword

The `LIMIT` keyword in MySQL is used to limit the number of rows returned by a query. This is especially useful when working with large datasets and wanting to display or analyze only a subset of the data. 

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
[WHERE condition]
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;
```

- **`offset`**: Specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.
- **`row_count`**: Specifies the maximum number of rows to return.

### Important Notes
1. **Zero-based Offset**: The first row starts with an offset of 0.
2. **Optional Offset**: If only one parameter is provided to `LIMIT`, it is taken as the row count.
3. **Common with Pagination**: Frequently used in pagination to control data display in sections or pages.
4. **Works with `ORDER BY`**: Often used with `ORDER BY` to define which subset of data to retrieve in a specific order.

### Examples

#### 1. Basic Usage
Retrieve the first 5 records from the `emp_details` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp_details
LIMIT 5;
```

#### 2. Using `LIMIT` with Offset
Skip the first 5 records and retrieve the next 5:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp_details
LIMIT 5, 5;
```

#### 3. `LIMIT` with `ORDER BY`
Retrieve the top 3 highest-salaried employees:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
ORDER BY SALARY DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### 4. Pagination Example
For a pagination system showing 10 records per page:
- **Page 1**:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    LIMIT 0, 10;
    ```

- **Page 2**:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    LIMIT 10, 10;
    ```

#### 5. Limiting Results with Calculated Columns
Retrieve the first 3 employees with the highest total compensation (`salary + commission`):

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, (SALARY + COMMISSION_PCT) AS TOTAL_COMPENSATION
FROM emp_details
ORDER BY TOTAL_COMPENSATION DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### Key Takeaways
- The `LIMIT` keyword allows efficient data retrieval when working with large datasets.
- Supports pagination and can be combined with `ORDER BY`.
- An optional offset parameter provides flexibility for more specific data slicing.
