# INNER JOIN in MySQL

## What is INNER JOIN?
An **INNER JOIN** in MySQL retrieves rows from two or more tables based on a condition where the values in the specified columns of the tables match. If no match is found, the rows are excluded from the result set.

---

## Syntax of INNER JOIN
```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- `table1` and `table2`: Tables being joined.
- `ON`: Specifies the condition that links the two tables.

## Example Tables in the `world` Database
The `world` database contains three main tables:
1. **`Country`**: Contains country details like `Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, etc.
2. **`City`**: Contains city details like `ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`.
3. **`CountryLanguage`**: Contains language details like `CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`.

## Example 1: Basic INNER JOIN Between `City` and `Country`
### Query
Get the names of cities and their respective countries.

```sql
SELECT City.Name AS CityName, Country.Name AS CountryName
FROM City
INNER JOIN Country
ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code;
```

### Explanation
- Joins `City` and `Country` tables where `City.CountryCode` matches `Country.Code`.
- Fetches the names of the cities and their corresponding countries.

### Sample Output
| CityName       | CountryName     |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Kabul          | Afghanistan     |
| Buenos Aires   | Argentina       |
| Sydney         | Australia       |

---

## Example 2: INNER JOIN with WHERE Clause
### Query
Get cities with a population greater than 1 million and their respective countries.

```sql
SELECT City.Name AS CityName, Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Population
FROM City
INNER JOIN Country
ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code
WHERE City.Population > 1000000;
```

### Explanation
- Filters the result of the join to only include cities with a population greater than 1 million.

### Sample Output
| CityName       | CountryName     | Population |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Kabul          | Afghanistan     | 1780000    |
| Buenos Aires   | Argentina       | 2982146    |

## Example 3: INNER JOIN Between `Country` and `CountryLanguage`
### Query
Get the official languages of all countries in Europe.

```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language
FROM Country
INNER JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
WHERE Country.Continent = 'Europe' AND CountryLanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';
```

### Explanation
- Joins `Country` with `CountryLanguage` on the `CountryCode`.
- Filters results to show only official languages for countries in Europe.

### Sample Output
| CountryName | Language   |
|-------------|------------|
| Germany     | German     |
| France      | French     |
| Italy       | Italian    |

## Example 4: INNER JOIN Across Three Tables
### Query
Get the names of cities, their countries, and the continents they belong to.

```sql
SELECT City.Name AS CityName, Country.Name AS CountryName, Country.Continent
FROM City
INNER JOIN Country
ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code
INNER JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
WHERE CountryLanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';
```

### Explanation
- Joins `City`, `Country`, and `CountryLanguage` tables.
- Filters rows where the language is marked as official.

### Sample Output
| CityName     | CountryName | Continent  |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Kabul        | Afghanistan | Asia       |
| Buenos Aires | Argentina   | South America |
| Sydney       | Australia   | Oceania    |

## Example 5: Aggregate Functions with INNER JOIN
### Query
Get the total population of each continent by joining `City` and `Country`.

```sql
SELECT Country.Continent, SUM(City.Population) AS TotalPopulation
FROM City
INNER JOIN Country
ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code
GROUP BY Country.Continent;
```

### Explanation
- Groups the result by `Continent` and calculates the total population of cities in each continent.

### Sample Output
| Continent      | TotalPopulation |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Asia           | 450000000       |
| Europe         | 300000000       |
| North America  | 180000000       |

## Key Points to Remember
1. **Mandatory Match**: An `INNER JOIN` excludes rows from both tables that do not satisfy the join condition.
2. **Common Use Case**: Used to combine data from related tables.
3. **Filter Results**: Can include additional filtering conditions using `WHERE`.
4. **Multiple Joins**: You can chain multiple `INNER JOINs` to combine more than two tables.

## Practice Questions
1. Get the names of all cities and their countries where the city population exceeds 5 million.
   ```sql
   SELECT City.Name, Country.Name
   FROM City
   INNER JOIN Country
   ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code
   WHERE City.Population > 5000000;
   ```

2. Find all countries in Asia and their official languages.
   ```sql
   SELECT Country.Name, CountryLanguage.Language
   FROM Country
   INNER JOIN CountryLanguage
   ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
   WHERE Country.Continent = 'Asia' AND CountryLanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';
   ```

3. List the top 5 most populous cities in the world along with their countries.
   ```sql
   SELECT City.Name, Country.Name, City.Population
   FROM City
   INNER JOIN Country
   ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code
   ORDER BY City.Population DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Conclusion
The `INNER JOIN` is one of the most commonly used join operations in MySQL. It is powerful for combining related data from multiple tables. Using the `world` database, you can practice various scenarios to master this concept.
