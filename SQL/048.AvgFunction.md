# MySQL AVG() Function
## 1. Overview of the AVG() Function
The AVG() function in MySQL is used to calculate the average value of a numeric column. It is commonly used in SELECT statements to provide the mean of the specified column.

#### Syntax:

``` sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

## 2. Key Points to Remember
- The `AVG()` function ignores NULL values when calculating the average.
- The result returned by `AVG()` is a floating-point value.
- You can use `AVG()` with the GROUP BY clause to find averages for each group of rows.

## 3. Examples Using the emp_details Table

### Example 1: Basic Average Salary Calculation

Calculate the average salary of all employees.

```sql
SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS average_salary
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Provides the average salary across all records.

### Example 2: Average Salary by Department
Find the average salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, AVG(SALARY) AS average_salary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID;
```

**Purpose**: Calculates the average salary grouped by DEPARTMENT_ID.

### Example 3: Average Salary with a Condition
Calculate the average salary for employees with a salary greater than $50,000.

```sql
SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS average_high_salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY > 50000;
```

**Purpose**: Returns the average salary of employees who earn more than $50,000.

### Example 4: Average Salary Excluding NULL Values
Even though AVG() inherently ignores NULL values, you can still demonstrate this:

```sql
SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS average_salary_excluding_nulls
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY IS NOT NULL;
```

**Purpose**: Ensures NULL salaries are excluded from the average calculation.

### Example 5: Average Salary with a Date Condition
Calculate the average salary of employees hired in the last five years.

```sql
SELECT AVG(SALARY) AS average_recent_hires_salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE STR_TO_DATE(HIRE_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d') >= CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 5 YEAR;
```

**Purpose**: Provides the average salary of employees hired within the past five years.


### Example 6: Display Average with Rounded Values
Display the average salary rounded to two decimal places.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(SALARY), 2) AS rounded_average_salary
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Shows the average salary with a precision of two decimal places.

## 4. Common Use Cases
- Financial Reporting: Calculate average revenue, expenses, or salaries.
- Employee Statistics: Analyze average performance metrics or engagement levels.
- Customer Analytics: Find average order values or product ratings.

## 5. Performance Considerations
- Calculating averages on large datasets can be resource-intensive, so ensure proper indexing of columns.
- Use WHERE clauses to filter data and improve query performance when calculating averages.
