# **MySQL `CURRENT_DATE()` Function**

The `CURRENT_DATE()` function in MySQL retrieves the current date without the time component. It is often used when you only need the date part for comparisons, inserts, or reporting purposes.

---

## **Syntax**
```sql
CURRENT_DATE()
```
or
```sql
CURRENT_DATE
```

- The function does not require parentheses, but including them is allowed.
- Returns the current date in the format **`YYYY-MM-DD`**.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **No Time Component:** Unlike `NOW()`, it returns only the date portion.
2. **Consistent Output:** Ensures the same date value across a query execution.
3. **Time Zone Independent:** It always reflects the current server date.

---

## **Examples with Different Conditions**

### **1. Retrieving the Current Date**
```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS TodayDate;
```
**Output:**  
`2024-11-26`

---

### **2. Inserting Current Date**

#### Example: Logging Today’s Date
```sql
INSERT INTO emp_details (EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, HIRE_DATE)
VALUES (102, 'Alice', CURRENT_DATE());
```
The `HIRE_DATE` column stores only the date when the record was created.

---

### **3. Using `CURRENT_DATE()` in WHERE Conditions**

#### **Condition: Records Matching Today’s Date**
Retrieve rows where a date column matches today’s date.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM emp_details
WHERE HIRE_DATE = CURRENT_DATE();
```

---

#### **Condition: Records Older Than 30 Days**
Retrieve rows created more than 30 days ago.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM emp_details
WHERE HIRE_DATE < CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

---

#### **Condition: Future Records**
Identify rows scheduled for dates in the future.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM emp_details
WHERE HIRE_DATE > CURRENT_DATE();
```

---

### **4. Calculating Date Differences**

#### Example: Employees Hired in the Last 7 Days
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, HIRE_DATE
FROM emp_details
WHERE HIRE_DATE BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 7 DAY AND CURRENT_DATE();
```

#### Example: Days Since an Employee’s Hire Date
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), HIRE_DATE) AS DaysSinceHired
FROM emp_details;
```

---

### **5. Combining `CURRENT_DATE()` with Other Functions**

#### Example: Extracting Month and Year from Current Date
```sql
SELECT YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()) AS CurrentYear, MONTH(CURRENT_DATE()) AS CurrentMonth;
```
**Output:**  
- CurrentYear: `2024`  
- CurrentMonth: `11`

#### Example: Check for Birthdays This Month
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, DOB
FROM emp_details
WHERE MONTH(DOB) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE());
```

---

### **6. Conditional Updates with `CURRENT_DATE()`**

#### Example: Update Status Based on Date
Mark employees as "Inactive" if they haven’t checked in for 30 days.

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET STATUS = 'Inactive'
WHERE LAST_CHECKIN < CURRENT_DATE() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
```

---

### **7. Using `CURRENT_DATE()` in Scheduled Queries**

#### Example: Schedule a Task to Run Only Today
You can use `CURRENT_DATE()` in an event or stored procedure to check for tasks due today.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM tasks
WHERE due_date = CURRENT_DATE();
```

---


### **Considerations**

1. **Precision:** Use `CURRENT_DATE()` when the time portion is irrelevant; for both date and time, use `NOW()`.
2. **Time Zones:** The date is based on the server's time zone; ensure server settings align with application requirements.
3. **Performance:** Avoid unnecessary function calls in WHERE clauses when working with large datasets (e.g., index-compatible comparisons).
