# UPDATE Statement in MySQL
The `UPDATE` statement in MySQL is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to update one or more rows based on specified conditions.

## Syntax of `UPDATE`
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
### Key Points:
- `table_name`: The table containing the data to be updated.
- `SET`: Specifies the column(s) and their new value(s).
- `WHERE`: Optional condition to specify which rows should be updated. Without WHERE, all rows will be updated.

## Examples of UPDATE
### 1. Updating a Single Column
Update the `SALARY` of an employee with `EMPLOYEE_ID = 101`:

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET SALARY = 80000
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 101;
```

### 2. Updating Multiple Columns
Change the `JOB_ID` and `SALARY` for an employee named 'Jane Smith':

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET JOB_ID = 'HR02', SALARY = 70000
WHERE FIRST_NAME = 'Jane' AND LAST_NAME = 'Smith';
```

### 3. Updating Rows Based on a Condition
Increase the `SALARY` of all employees in the 'HR' department by 10%:

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET SALARY = SALARY * 1.10
WHERE JOB_ID LIKE 'HR%';
```

### 4. Updating Without WHERE
Set the `COMMISSION_PCT` to 0.1 for all employees:

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET COMMISSION_PCT = 0.1;
```
> **_NOTE:_** Use this carefully as it updates every row in the table.

### 5. Using Subquery in UPDATE
Set the `MANAGER_ID` of all employees in department 102 to the EMPLOYEE_ID of 'John Doe':

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET MANAGER_ID = (SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID FROM emp_details WHERE FIRST_NAME = 'John' AND LAST_NAME = 'Doe')
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 102;
```

## Common Errors and Solutions
1. Error: Updating rows without a WHERE clause
- Cause: Forgetting to add a WHERE condition updates all rows.
- Solution: Always double-check the WHERE clause to avoid unintentional updates.

2. Error: Subquery returns more than one row
- Cause: The subquery in the SET clause returns multiple rows.
- Solution: Ensure the subquery returns a single value using LIMIT or aggregation.

3. Error: Duplicate entry for key
- Cause: Trying to update a UNIQUE column with a duplicate value.
- Solution: Ensure that the new value for the UNIQUE column is not already present in the table.

## Conclusion
The UPDATE statement in MySQL is a powerful tool for modifying data in a database. By combining it with conditions, subqueries, and calculations, you can perform a wide range of data updates. However, always use caution, especially when omitting the WHERE clause, to prevent unintended changes.
