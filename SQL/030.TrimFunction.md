# MySQL TRIM(), LTRIM(), and RTRIM() Functions

The TRIM() function in MySQL is used to remove unwanted spaces from both the beginning and end of a string. Additionally, LTRIM() removes leading spaces (from the start), and RTRIM() removes trailing spaces (from the end).

## 1. Syntax
**TRIM()**: Removes both leading and trailing spaces.

```sql
TRIM([string])
```

**LTRIM()**: Removes only leading spaces.

```sql
LTRIM([string])
```

**RTRIM()**: Removes only trailing spaces.

```sql
RTRIM([string])
```

## 2. Examples Using emp_details Table
### Example 1: Remove Both Leading and Trailing Spaces from FIRST_NAME
We can temporarily add spaces around FIRST_NAME and then remove them using TRIM() to observe the changes in length.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ') AS FIRST_NAME_with_spaces,
       LENGTH(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ')) AS length_with_spaces,
       TRIM(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ')) AS FIRST_NAME_trimmed,
       LENGTH(TRIM(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   '))) AS length_without_spaces
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Adds leading and trailing spaces around FIRST_NAME and removes them with TRIM().
**Verification**: Compares lengths before and after trimming to verify space removal.

### Example 2: Remove Only Leading Spaces from LAST_NAME
Using LTRIM() to remove only leading spaces:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       CONCAT('    ', LAST_NAME) AS LAST_NAME_with_leading_spaces,
       LENGTH(CONCAT('    ', LAST_NAME)) AS length_with_leading_spaces,
       LTRIM(CONCAT('    ', LAST_NAME)) AS LAST_NAME_trimmed_leading,
       LENGTH(LTRIM(CONCAT('    ', LAST_NAME))) AS length_without_leading_spaces
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Adds only leading spaces to LAST_NAME and removes them with LTRIM().
**Verification**: Checks the length with and without leading spaces.

### Example 3: Remove Only Trailing Spaces from JOB_ID
Using RTRIM() to remove only trailing spaces from JOB_ID:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       CONCAT(JOB_ID, '     ') AS JOB_ID_with_trailing_spaces,
       LENGTH(CONCAT(JOB_ID, '     ')) AS length_with_trailing_spaces,
       RTRIM(CONCAT(JOB_ID, '     ')) AS JOB_ID_trimmed_trailing,
       LENGTH(RTRIM(CONCAT(JOB_ID, '     '))) AS length_without_trailing_spaces
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Adds trailing spaces to JOB_ID and removes them with RTRIM().
**Verification**: Compares the lengths with and without trailing spaces.

### Example 4: Trim Spaces Added to Both FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME
This example demonstrates how to apply TRIM() on concatenated columns with spaces:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ', LAST_NAME, '   ') AS full_name_with_spaces,
       LENGTH(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ', LAST_NAME, '   ')) AS length_with_spaces,
       TRIM(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ', LAST_NAME, '   ')) AS full_name_trimmed,
       LENGTH(TRIM(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   ', LAST_NAME, '   '))) AS length_without_spaces
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Adds spaces around both FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME and then removes them.
**Verification**: Checks the length of the full name before and after trimming.

### Example 5: Trim Spaces in Combination with UPPER() and LOWER()
Using TRIM() with UPPER() on FIRST_NAME and LOWER() on LAST_NAME:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       UPPER(TRIM(CONCAT('   ', FIRST_NAME, '   '))) AS FIRST_NAME_upper_trimmed,
       LOWER(TRIM(CONCAT('   ', LAST_NAME, '   '))) AS LAST_NAME_lower_trimmed
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Adds spaces, removes them with TRIM(), and formats FIRST_NAME in uppercase and LAST_NAME in lowercase.
**Verification**: Shows the result of both TRIM() and case conversion.

These examples demonstrate how TRIM(), LTRIM(), and RTRIM() can be applied to different scenarios in MySQL, allowing us to manipulate string data effectively without permanently modifying it in the database.
