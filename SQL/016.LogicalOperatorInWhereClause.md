### Logical Operators in SQL

Logical operators in SQL are used to combine multiple conditions in queries, allowing for more complex data filtering. These operators evaluate conditions and return results based on whether the condition is `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `UNKNOWN`.

### Common Logical Operators in SQL:

- **AND**: Combines two conditions and returns `TRUE` only if both conditions are true.
- **OR**: Combines two conditions and returns `TRUE` if at least one of the conditions is true.
- **NOT**: Negates a condition, returning the opposite boolean value of the expression.

### 1. AND Operator

- **Example 1**: Employees in Department 50 and Earning More Than 4000
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 50 AND SALARY > 4000;
    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns all employees who work in department 50 and earn a salary greater than 4000.

- **Example 2**: Employees First Name is "William" and Salary Greater Than 5000
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE FIRST_NAME="William" AND SALARY > 5000;
    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns employees who's first name is "William", with a salary above 5000.

### 2. OR Operator

- **Example 1**: Employees with Job Title 'IT_PROG' or Salary Less Than 3000
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE JOB_ID = 'IT_PROG' OR SALARY < 3000;
    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns employees who either have the job title 'IT_PROG' or earn less than 3000.

- **Example 2**: Employees in Department 40 or Hired Before '01-JAN-2005'
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 40 OR HIRE_DATE < '01-JAN-2005';
    ```
    **Explanation**: Finds employees who either belong to department 40 or were hired before January 1, 2005.

### 3. NOT Operator

- **Example 1**: Employees Not in Department 30
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE NOT (DEPARTMENT_ID = 30);
    ```
    **Explanation**: Excludes employees from department 30 and returns everyone else.

- **Example 2**: Employees Who Are Not 'FI_ACCOUNT'
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE NOT (JOB_ID = 'FI_ACCOUNT');
    ```
    **Explanation**: Filters out employees with the job title 'FI_ACCOUNT' and returns all others.

### 4. AND with Range of Values

- **Example 1**: Employees with Salary Between 3000 and 8000 and in Department 50
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 3000 AND 8000 AND DEPARTMENT_ID = 50;
    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns employees who earn between 3000 and 8000 and are part of department 50.

    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns employees earning more than 10000 or working in department 10.

- **Example 2**: Employees with Job Title 'HR_REP' or Earning Less Than 4000
    ```sql

    WHERE JOB_ID = 'HR_REP' OR SALARY < 4000;
    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns employees with the job title 'HR_REP' or a salary less than 4000.

### 6. Combining AND and OR

- **Example 1**: Employees in Department 50 and Earning More Than 4000 or Job Title 'ST_CLERK'
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM emp_details
    WHERE (DEPARTMENT_ID = 50 AND SALARY > 4000) OR JOB_ID = 'ST_CLERK';
    ```
    **Explanation**: Returns employees who either work in department 50 and earn more than 4000 or have the job title 'ST_CLERK'.

- **Example 2**: Employees in Department 90 or Job Title 'IT_PROG' and Hired After '01-JAN-2005'

    ```
    **Explanation**: Excludes employees hired before January 1, 2005, or those whose job title is 'AC_MGR'.

### 8. Nested Logical Conditions

- **Example 1**: Employees in Department 20 or Salary More Than 5000 but Not 'HR_REP'

### Difference Between Relational and Logical Operators

| **Relational Operators**           | **Logical Operators**           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Used to compare values of two expressions. | Used to combine multiple conditions. |
| Examples include `=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, etc. | Examples include `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`. |
| Returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on comparison. | Returns `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `UNKNOWN` based on logical evaluation of conditions. |
| Applies to a single condition at a time. | Combines multiple conditions to form complex queries. |
