# MySQL SQRT() Function

The **`SQRT()` function** in MySQL returns the square root of a given non-negative number. This function is useful for mathematical and statistical calculations, including scaling and normalizing data.

## Syntax
```sql
SQRT(number)
```
- **`number`**: The number for which the square root is calculated. Must be non-negative.

### Example Scenarios Using `emp_details` Table

#### 1. Calculating the Square Root of Salary
Let's calculate the square root of the **`SALARY`** column for all employees. This could be used to normalize salary data, especially for comparisons.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       SQRT(SALARY) AS sqrt_salary
FROM emp_details;
```

#### 2. Filtering Employees with Salary Above a Threshold Using Square Roots
Suppose we want to filter employees with a square root of their salary above a certain threshold (e.g., 80).

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       SQRT(SALARY) AS sqrt_salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE SQRT(SALARY) > 80;
```

#### 3. Using `SQRT()` with a Derived Value (Bonus Calculation)
Assume we are calculating a "performance bonus" based on the square root of **`SALARY`** multiplied by a factor, such as 10, for employees in a specific department.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID, 
       SQRT(SALARY * 10) AS performance_bonus
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 50;
```

#### 4. Handling Cases of Zero or Missing Salary Data
The **`SQRT()`** function requires a non-negative number, so we can use conditional logic to handle cases with zero or missing salary data.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       CASE 
           WHEN SALARY > 0 THEN SQRT(SALARY)
           ELSE NULL 
       END AS safe_sqrt_salary
FROM emp_details;
```

#### 5. Combining `SQRT()` with Other Mathematical Operations
We can use **`SQRT()`** with other mathematical functions, such as `POWER()`, for more complex calculations. For example, we can calculate the square root of salary squared divided by 100.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       SQRT(POWER(SALARY, 3) / 100) AS complex_sqrt
FROM emp_details
WHERE JOB_ID = 'IT_PROG';
```

#### 6. Calculating a Salary Efficiency Metric Using Square Roots
For a hypothetical "efficiency metric," we can normalize salary by dividing it by the square root of **`DEPARTMENT_ID`**, assuming department IDs are meaningful in this context.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID, 
       SALARY / SQRT(DEPARTMENT_ID) AS efficiency_metric
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IS NOT NULL;
```

### Practical Applications

1. **Normalizing Data**: Calculating the square root of salary data for comparisons.
2. **Data Transformation**: Using square roots for transformations in statistical calculations.
3. **Custom Metrics**: Creating metrics based on the square root to adjust scales.
