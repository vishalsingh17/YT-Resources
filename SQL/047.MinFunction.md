# MySQL MIN() Function:
## 1. Overview of the MIN() Function
The `MIN()` function in MySQL is used to find the minimum value in a set of values.
It is often applied to numerical, date, and string columns in SQL queries.
The function ignores NULL values by default.
### Syntax:

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
## 2. Key Points to Remember
- The `MIN()` function can be used with the GROUP BY clause to find minimum values for each group.
- It can be applied to different data types such as integers, floats, dates, and strings.
- When used on strings, `MIN()` returns the value that would appear last in a dictionary or lexicographic order.

## 3. Examples Using the emp_details Table
### Example 1: Basic Minimum Salary Calculation
Find the lowest salary among all employees.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, MIN(SALARY) AS lowest_salary
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Returns the lowest value in the SALARY column.

### Example 2: Minimum Salary by Department
Find the lowest salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, MIN(SALARY) AS lowest_salary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID;
```
**Purpose**: Calculates the minimum salary for each department using GROUP BY.

### Example 3: Minimum Hire Date (Most Recent Hire)
Identify the most recent hire date.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, MIN(HIRE_DATE) AS latest_hire_date
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Retrieves the latest hire date after converting the HIRE_DATE column to DATE format.

### Example 4: Minimum Salary with a Condition
Find the minimum salary for employees with a specific job title (e.g., IT_PROG).

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, MIN(SALARY) AS lowest_salary_developers
FROM emp_details
WHERE JOB_ID = 'IT_PROG';
```

**Purpose**: Shows the lowest salary for employees with the job ID is IT_PROG.

### Example 5: Minimum Value Ignoring Specific Conditions
Find the minimum salary excluding certain departments (e.g., Department 20).

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, MIN(SALARY) AS lowest_salary_excluding_dept_20
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID != 20;
```

**Purpose**: Retrieves the lowest salary while excluding employees from Department 20.

### Example 6: Minimum String Value
Find the employee with the "last" name in lexicographic order.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, MIN(LAST_NAME) AS last_name_in_order
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: Returns the last name that appears last alphabetically in the LAST_NAME column.

### Example 7: Minimum with Multiple Conditions
Find the minimum salary for employees with the "last" name in lexicographic order or in a specific department (e.g., Department 10).

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, MIN(SALARY) AS min_salary_post_2015_dept_10
FROM emp_details
WHERE MIN(LAST_NAME) OR DEPARTMENT_ID = 10;
```

**Purpose**: Retrieves the lowest salary for employees with the "last" name in lexicographic order or in Department 10.

## 4. Common Use Cases
- Financial Analysis: Identify minimum revenue, profit, or cost data.
- HR Metrics: Find the minimum salary, hire date, or performance score.
- Customer Insights: Determine the lowest purchase amount or rating.

## 5. Performance Considerations
- Indexes: Ensure the column being queried has an index to improve query performance.
- Large Datasets: Using MIN() on large datasets can be resource-intensive, so consider optimizing with proper indexing and query filters.
