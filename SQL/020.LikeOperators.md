# MySQL LIKE Operator

The `LIKE` operator in MySQL is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is typically used in the `WHERE` clause to filter rows based on pattern matching. The `LIKE` operator allows for more flexible comparisons than the `=` operator by using two wildcards:
- `%`: Matches zero or more characters.
- `_`: Matches exactly one character.

## Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
```

### Key Points:
- **Pattern Matching**: The `LIKE` operator is case-insensitive by default in MySQL, but this behavior can vary based on the collation used.
- **Wildcards**: You can use `%` and `_` to create more dynamic search conditions.
- **Used with Text**: It's typically used to filter text-based columns but can also work with numeric or date values formatted as strings.

## Examples Using `emp_details` Table

Assume the following structure for the `emp_details` table:
- **EMPLOYEE_ID**: ID of the employee.
- **FIRST_NAME**: First name of the employee.
- **LAST_NAME**: Last name of the employee.
- **SALARY**: Salary of the employee.
- **HIRE_DATE**: Date the employee was hired.

### 1. Basic Usage with `%` Wildcard

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose first name starts with 'A'.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'A%';
```

**Explanation**: This query will return all employees whose first name starts with 'A' (e.g., 'Adam', 'Amelia', etc.).

### 2. Searching for a Pattern Anywhere in a Column

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose last name contains 'son' anywhere.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE LAST_NAME LIKE '%son%';
```

**Explanation**: This query returns employees whose last name contains 'son' anywhere (e.g., 'Johnson', 'Anderson').

### 3. Matching the End of a String

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose first name ends with 'n'.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE '%n';
```

**Explanation**: This query returns employees whose first name ends with 'n' (e.g., 'John', 'Ellen').

### 4. Using `_` Wildcard for Single-Character Matching

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose first name is five characters long and starts with 'J'.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'J____';
```

**Explanation**: This query retrieves employees whose first name is exactly five characters long and starts with 'J' (e.g., 'James', 'Julia').

### 5. Combining `LIKE` with Other Conditions

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose first name starts with 'M' and whose salary is greater than 5000.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE FIRST_NAME LIKE 'M%' AND SALARY > 5000;
```

**Explanation**: This query filters employees whose first name starts with 'M' and whose salary is greater than 5000 (e.g., 'Michael' with salary 6000).

### 6. Case Sensitivity with `LIKE`

By default, `LIKE` is case-insensitive. However, if you want a case-sensitive search, you can use the `BINARY` keyword.

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose first name starts with lowercase 'a' (case-sensitive).

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE BINARY FIRST_NAME LIKE 'a%';
```

**Explanation**: This query only returns employees whose first name starts with lowercase 'a' (e.g., 'amy', 'alex').

### 7. Matching Numeric Columns

Though primarily used for text columns, the `LIKE` operator can be used on numeric columns formatted as strings.

**Example**: Retrieve employees whose employee ID starts with '12'.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID LIKE '12%';
```

**Explanation**: This query retrieves all employees whose `EMPLOYEE_ID` starts with '12', such as `1201`, `1234`, etc.

## Key Takeaways

- **Wildcards**: `%` is used to match any number of characters (including zero), and `_` matches exactly one character.
- **Flexible Search**: `LIKE` allows flexible search patterns and can be combined with other operators (`AND`, `OR`, etc.) for complex queries.
- **Case Sensitivity**: By default, `LIKE` is case-insensitive, but you can make it case-sensitive using `BINARY`.
- **Use in Filtering**: It's especially useful for filtering text columns, but can also be applied to numeric or date columns formatted as strings.
