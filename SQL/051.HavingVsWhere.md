# WHERE vs HAVING in MySQL

## Introduction
Both `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses are used to filter records in MySQL. However, they serve different purposes and operate at different stages of query execution:

- **`WHERE`**: Filters rows before any grouping or aggregation takes place.
- **`HAVING`**: Filters aggregated data after `GROUP BY`.

## Key Differences

| Feature              | `WHERE` Clause                         | `HAVING` Clause                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**          | Filters rows based on conditions.      | Filters groups after aggregation.        |
| **Execution Stage**  | Applied before grouping or aggregation.| Applied after grouping or aggregation.   |
| **Used With**        | Works with regular columns.            | Works with aggregate functions.          |
| **Mandatory**        | Optional in a query.                  | Optional, only needed with aggregation. |

## Syntax

### `WHERE` Clause
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### `HAVING` Clause
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING aggregate_condition;
```

---

## Examples

### 1. Basic Usage of `WHERE`
Filter employees with a salary greater than 50,000.
```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY > 50000;
```

### 2. Basic Usage of `HAVING`
Find departments where the total salary exceeds 15,000.
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY) AS TotalSalary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 15000;
```

---

### 3. Combining `WHERE` and `HAVING`
Filter employees birth is before 2020 and find departments where the total salary exceeds 50,000.
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY) AS TotalSalary
FROM emp_details
WHERE DOB < '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 50000;
```

---

### 4. Using Aggregate Functions with `HAVING`
List job IDs where the average salary exceeds 60,000.
```sql
SELECT JOB_ID, AVG(SALARY) AS AvgSalary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY JOB_ID
HAVING AVG(SALARY) > 60000;
```

---

### 5. Using `WHERE` with Logical Conditions
Filter employees with a salary between 40,000 and 80,000.
```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;
```

---


### 7. `WHERE` Clause with Non-Aggregated Columns
Get employees working in department 10.
```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 10;
```

---

### 8. Using Aliased Columns in `HAVING`
Find departments with an average salary greater than 60,000 (using alias in `HAVING`).
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, AVG(SALARY) AS AvgSalary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
HAVING AvgSalary > 60000;
```

---

### 9. `WHERE` Cannot Be Used with Aggregate Functions
Incorrect query:
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY) AS TotalSalary
FROM emp_details
WHERE SUM(SALARY) > 100000; -- This will cause an error
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID;
```

Correct query using `HAVING`:
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, SUM(SALARY) AS TotalSalary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 100000;
```

## Key Notes
1. **`WHERE` vs `HAVING`:**  
   - Use `WHERE` to filter rows before aggregation.  
   - Use `HAVING` to filter aggregated data after `GROUP BY`.

2. **Performance Tip:**  
   Applying filters in `WHERE` is more efficient than applying them in `HAVING` because `WHERE` reduces the dataset size before grouping.

3. **Use Case:**  
   - Use `WHERE` for filtering raw data (e.g., filter employees by `HIRE_DATE` or `SALARY`).  
   - Use `HAVING` for filtering summarized data (e.g., departments with high total salaries).
