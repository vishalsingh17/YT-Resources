# **FULL JOIN in MySQL**  

## **Introduction**  
A **FULL JOIN** (or **FULL OUTER JOIN**) in SQL returns all records from both tables, with matching records from both sides where available. If there is no match, `NULL` values appear in the columns of the table that does not have a corresponding row.

### **Key Characteristics of FULL JOIN:**  
âœ… Returns all rows from both tables.  
âœ… If there is a match, it returns combined data from both tables.  
âœ… If there is no match, `NULL` values are returned for missing data.

## **FULL JOIN in MySQL**  
MySQL **does not natively support FULL JOIN**, but it can be simulated using a **UNION** of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.  

### **Syntax (Simulating FULL JOIN in MySQL)**  
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM left_table
LEFT JOIN right_table
ON left_table.common_column = right_table.common_column
UNION
SELECT columns
FROM left_table
RIGHT JOIN right_table
ON left_table.common_column = right_table.common_column;
```

## **Understanding FULL JOIN with the `world` Database**  
The `world` database contains three main tables:  
1. **`Country`** â€“ Stores country details (`Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`, etc.).  
2. **`City`** â€“ Stores city details (`ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`).  
3. **`CountryLanguage`** â€“ Stores languages spoken in each country (`CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`).  

We will use **FULL JOIN** to explore relationships between these tables.

## **Example 1: Retrieve All Countries and Their Cities (Including Countries Without Cities and Cities Without Countries)**  
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS CityName
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN City
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode
UNION
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS CityName
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN City
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures all **countries** are included, even those without a matching city.  
- The **RIGHT JOIN** ensures all **cities** are included, even those without a matching country.  
- The **UNION** merges both results, simulating a **FULL JOIN**.  

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName  | CityName  |
|-------------|----------|
| Afghanistan | Kabul    |
| Albania     | Tirana   |
| Andorra     | NULL     |
| NULL        | UnknownCity |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**:  
- Andorra has no city (`NULL` appears in `CityName`).  
- `UnknownCity` has no country (`NULL` appears in `CountryName`).

## **Example 2: Retrieve All Countries and Their Official Languages (Including Countries Without Languages and Languages Without Countries)**  
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
UNION
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures all **countries** are included, even if they have no official language.  
- The **RIGHT JOIN** ensures all **languages** are included, even if they have no corresponding country.  
- The **UNION** merges both results.  

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName | Language  |
|------------|----------|
| Afghanistan | Pashto   |
| Albania     | Albanian |
| Andorra     | NULL     |
| NULL        | Klingon  |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**:  
- Andorra has no listed language (`NULL` appears in `Language`).  
- `Klingon` has no associated country (`NULL` appears in `CountryName`).

## **Example 3: Retrieve All Countries and Their GDP (Including Countries Without GDP Data and GDP Data Without Countries)**  
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, GDPData.GNP AS GDP
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT CountryCode, GNP
    FROM Country
    WHERE GNP IS NOT NULL
) AS GDPData
ON Country.Code = GDPData.CountryCode
UNION
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, GDPData.GNP AS GDP
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN (
    SELECT CountryCode, GNP
    FROM Country
    WHERE GNP IS NOT NULL
) AS GDPData
ON Country.Code = GDPData.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures all **countries** are included, even if they have no GDP data.  
- The **RIGHT JOIN** ensures all **GDP records** are included, even if they donâ€™t have a matching country.  
- The **UNION** merges both results.  

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName  | GDP       |
|-------------|----------|
| Afghanistan | 5976.00  |
| Albania     | 4795.00  |
| NULL        | 10000.00 |
| Andorra     | NULL     |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**:  
- The last row has a `NULL` country, meaning GDP data exists without a matching country.  
- Andorra has `NULL` GDP, meaning no GDP data is recorded.

## **Key Differences: FULL JOIN vs. LEFT JOIN vs. RIGHT JOIN**  
| Feature         | LEFT JOIN                         | RIGHT JOIN                          | FULL JOIN (Using UNION) |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Records from Left Table | All rows are included | Only matching rows are included | All rows are included |
| Records from Right Table | Only matching rows are included | All rows are included | All rows are included |
| Missing Data Handling | `NULL` appears in right table columns | `NULL` appears in left table columns | `NULL` appears in both left & right table columns |

## **Practice Questions**  
Try writing SQL queries using the `world` database:  

1. **Find all countries and their cities, ensuring that both countries without cities and cities without countries are included.**  
2. **Retrieve all languages and their respective countries, ensuring that languages without countries and countries without languages are included.**  
3. **List all GDP values and their corresponding countries, ensuring GDP data without countries and countries without GDP data are included.**  
4. **Find all capital cities and their respective countries, ensuring that both capital cities without countries and countries without capitals are included.**  

---

## **Conclusion**  
- MySQL **does not** have built-in **FULL JOIN**, but it can be simulated using `UNION` between `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.  
- **FULL JOIN** ensures that **all records from both tables** are included, with `NULL` values where matches are missing.  
- The `world` database provides an excellent way to practice **FULL JOIN**, especially with `Country`, `City`, and `CountryLanguage` tables.
