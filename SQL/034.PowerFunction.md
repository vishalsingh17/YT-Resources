# MySQL POWER() Function

The **`POWER()` function** in MySQL returns the result of a number raised to the power of another number. This function is commonly used in mathematical calculations within SQL queries.

## Syntax
```sql
POWER(base, exponent)
```
- **`base`**: The number to be raised.
- **`exponent`**: The power to which the base number is raised.

### Example Scenarios Using `emp_details` Table

#### 1. Using `POWER()` to Calculate Bonus Based on Salary
Suppose we want to compute a hypothetical bonus based on the **`SALARY`** column, where the bonus is calculated as the square (power of 2) of the salary for employees.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       POWER(SALARY, 2) AS bonus
FROM emp_details;
```

#### 2. Estimating Growth Rate by Raising Salary to a Specified Power
Assuming we want to project future salary growth by raising current salaries to a power, we can raise the **`SALARY`** column by 1.1 (simulating a 10% increase factor).

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       POWER(SALARY, 1.1) AS projected_salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 50;
```

#### 3. Using `POWER()` to Calculate the Inverse (Negative Exponent) for Low Salary
For demonstration, we can calculate the inverse of salaries under 3,000 by raising them to the power of -1, which can be useful in normalization or other transformations.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       POWER(SALARY, -1) AS inverse_salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE SALARY < 3000;
```

#### 4. Calculating the Square Root Using `POWER()`
While MySQL has a `SQRT()` function, we can calculate the square root of the **`SALARY`** using `POWER(SALARY, 0.5)`.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       POWER(SALARY, 0.5) AS sqrt_salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE JOB_ID = 'ST_CLERK';
```

#### 5. Combining `POWER()` with Other Columns
Let's calculate a hypothetical "efficiency score" by dividing **`SALARY`** by 10 and then raising it to the power of the **`DEPARTMENT_ID`**.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, DEPARTMENT_ID, 
       POWER(SALARY / 10, DEPARTMENT_ID) AS efficiency_score
FROM emp_details
WHERE MANAGER_ID IS NOT NULL;
```

#### 6. Handling Edge Cases with Zero and Negative Values in `POWER()`
If an employee’s salary is zero or negative, the `POWER()` function might yield unexpected results. Here’s an example with a conditional to handle such cases.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SALARY, 
       CASE 
           WHEN SALARY > 0 THEN POWER(SALARY, 2)
           ELSE NULL 
       END AS positive_power
FROM emp_details;
```

### Practical Applications

1. **Salary Forecasting**: Estimating salary growth projections over time.
2. **Data Normalization**: Calculating inverse values for normalization.
3. **Efficiency Metrics**: Using department or job roles as exponent factors for different metrics.
