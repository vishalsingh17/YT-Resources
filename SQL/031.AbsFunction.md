# MySQL `ABS()` Function

The `ABS()` function in MySQL is used to return the absolute (non-negative) value of a given number. 
It can be applied to both positive and negative numbers to ensure only positive values are returned. 
This is useful in cases where calculations involve potential negative values, but only the magnitude is required.

## Syntax

```sql
ABS(number)
```

- **number**: The value for which you want to get the absolute value.

## Key Points
- If the value is positive or zero, `ABS()` returns the same value.
- If the value is negative, `ABS()` returns its positive equivalent.

## Example Scenarios with `emp_details` Table

For these examples, we’ll use the `emp_details` table with columns such as `EMPLOYEE_ID`, `SALARY`, and `COMMISSION_PCT` 
to demonstrate various ways of using the `ABS()` function.

### Example 1: Applying `ABS()` on Negative Numbers Derived from Expressions
Use `ABS()` to display positive values for an expression that could otherwise produce negative values.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       SALARY,
       (SALARY - 20000) AS SALARY_DIFF,
       ABS(SALARY - 20000) AS ABS_SALARY_DIFF
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**:
Here, we calculate a difference that could yield negative values (by subtracting 20000 from `SALARY`). Using `ABS()` 
ensures the result remains non-negative.


### Example 2: Basic Usage of `ABS()` with Negative and Positive Values
Retrieve the absolute values for a custom set of positive and negative salary values.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       SALARY,
       ABS(SALARY - 5000) AS ABS_SALARY_DIFF
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**: 
This example calculates the difference between each employee’s salary and a specified value (5000). 
The `ABS()` function is used to make sure the difference is always positive.

### Example 3: Calculating Absolute Differences Between Two Columns
Calculate the absolute difference between `SALARY` and `COMMISSION_PCT`.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       SALARY,
       MANAGER_ID,
       (MANAGER_ID - SALARY),
       ABS(MANAGER_ID - SALARY) AS ABS_DIFF_SALARY_COMMISSION
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**:
Here, we’re calculating the absolute difference between `SALARY` and `COMMISSION_PCT`, which could be negative if 
`COMMISSION_PCT` is greater than `SALARY`. `ABS()` makes the result positive.

### Example 4: Using `ABS()` with Calculations in a `WHERE` Clause
Find employees whose absolute salary difference from 10,000 is greater than 3,000.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID,
       FIRST_NAME,
       SALARY,
       ABS(SALARY - 10000) AS ABS_DIFF
FROM emp_details
WHERE ABS(SALARY - 10000) > 3000;
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, `ABS()` is used within the `WHERE` clause to filter employees. Only employees whose salary difference 
from 10,000 exceeds 3,000 will be returned.

### Example 5: Using `ABS()` with Aggregated Calculations
Calculate the average absolute salary deviation from a target value (e.g., 8000).

```sql
SELECT AVG(ABS(SALARY - 8000)) AS AVG_ABS_DEVIATION
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**:
In this example, `ABS()` is used in combination with the `AVG()` aggregate function to find the average absolute 
deviation of all salaries from 8000.


## Summary

The `ABS()` function in MySQL is versatile for situations where only the magnitude of values is needed, regardless of sign. 
It can be applied to various calculations involving both individual columns and complex expressions, making it essential 
for operations requiring positive-only values.
