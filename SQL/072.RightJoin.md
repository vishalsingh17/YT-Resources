# **RIGHT JOIN in MySQL**  

## **Introduction**  
A **RIGHT JOIN** in MySQL retrieves all records from the **right table** and the matching records from the **left table**. If there is no match in the left table, `NULL` values are returned for the left tableâ€™s columns.

---

## **Syntax of RIGHT JOIN**  
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM left_table
RIGHT JOIN right_table
ON left_table.common_column = right_table.common_column;
```
- `left_table`: The table from which matching rows will be retrieved. If no match is found, `NULL` values are returned.  
- `right_table`: The table from which **all rows** will be retrieved.  
- `ON`: Specifies the condition that links the two tables.

## **Understanding RIGHT JOIN with the `world` Database**  
The `world` database contains three main tables:  
1. **`Country`** â€“ Stores country details (`Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`, etc.).  
2. **`City`** â€“ Stores city details (`ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`).  
3. **`CountryLanguage`** â€“ Stores languages spoken in each country (`CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`).  

We will use **RIGHT JOIN** to explore relationships between these tables.

## **Example 1: Retrieve All Cities and Their Respective Countries**  
This query retrieves all cities along with their country names. If a city does not have a matching country, the country name will be `NULL`.  

```sql
SELECT City.Name AS CityName, Country.Name AS CountryName
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN City
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**
- The **RIGHT JOIN** ensures that all **cities** are included, even if they do not have a matching country in the `Country` table.  

### **Sample Output**
| CityName      | CountryName  |
|--------------|-------------|
| Kabul        | Afghanistan |
| Buenos Aires | Argentina   |
| Sydney       | Australia   |
| UnknownCity  | NULL        |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: The last row contains a city (`UnknownCity`) that does not have a matching country, so `NULL` appears.

---

## **Example 2: Retrieve All Languages and Their Respective Countries**  
This query retrieves all languages from the `CountryLanguage` table along with their corresponding country names. If a language is listed but does not have a matching country, `NULL` will appear in the `CountryName` column.  

```sql
SELECT CountryLanguage.Language, Country.Name AS CountryName
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The **RIGHT JOIN** ensures that all **languages** are included, even if they do not have a corresponding country in the `Country` table.  

### **Sample Output**
| Language  | CountryName  |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pashto    | Afghanistan |
| Dari      | Afghanistan |
| Albanian  | Albania     |
| Klingon   | NULL        |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: The language **Klingon** does not have a corresponding country, so `NULL` appears.

---

## **Example 3: Retrieve All Countries and Their Capital Cities (Including Cities Without Countries)**  
```sql
SELECT City.Name AS CapitalCity, Country.Name AS CountryName
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN City
ON Country.Capital = City.ID;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The **RIGHT JOIN** ensures that all **cities** are included, even if they do not have a corresponding country.  

### **Sample Output**
| CapitalCity         | CountryName  |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Kabul             | Afghanistan |
| Tirana           | Albania     |
| Andorra la Vella | Andorra     |
| UnknownCity      | NULL        |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: The last row contains a city that does not belong to any country.

## **Example 4: Retrieve All Countries and Their GDP (Even If GDP Data is Missing)**  
```sql
SELECT GDPData.GNP AS GDP, Country.Name AS CountryName
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN (
    SELECT CountryCode, GNP
    FROM Country
    WHERE GNP IS NOT NULL
) AS GDPData
ON Country.Code = GDPData.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**  
- This query ensures that all countries with GDP data are retrieved, even if some do not have a matching entry in the `Country` table.  

### **Sample Output**
| GDP       | CountryName  |
|-----------|-------------|
| 5976.00   | Afghanistan |
| 4795.00   | Albania     |
| NULL      | NULL        |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: The last row has `NULL` values, meaning GDP data exists without a corresponding country.

## **Key Differences: LEFT JOIN vs. RIGHT JOIN**
| Feature         | LEFT JOIN                         | RIGHT JOIN                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Records from Left Table | All rows are included | Only matching rows are included |
| Records from Right Table | Only matching rows are included | All rows are included |
| Missing Data Handling | `NULL` appears in right table columns | `NULL` appears in left table columns |

## **Practice Questions**  
Try writing SQL queries using the `world` database:  

1. **Find all cities and their respective countries, ensuring that cities without countries are included.**  
2. **Retrieve all languages and their respective countries, ensuring languages without countries are included.**  
3. **List all GDP values and their corresponding countries, ensuring GDP data without countries is included.**  
4. **Find all capital cities and their respective countries, ensuring capital cities without countries are included.**

## **Conclusion**  
- The **RIGHT JOIN** in MySQL ensures that all records from the **right table** are included, even if there is no matching data in the **left table**.  
- It is useful when you need to retain all records from one table while displaying related data from another, even when some relationships are missing.  
- The `world` database provides a great way to practice **RIGHT JOINs**, especially with `Country`, `City`, and `CountryLanguage` tables.
