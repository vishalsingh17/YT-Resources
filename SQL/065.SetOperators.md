# **Set Operators in MySQL**

## **Introduction**
Set operators in MySQL are used to combine results from multiple `SELECT` queries into a single result set. These operators include **UNION**, **UNION ALL**, **INTERSECT** (starting from MySQL 8.0.31), and **EXCEPT** (starting from MySQL 8.0.31). They are useful for performing operations on the result sets of two or more queries.

## **Supported Set Operators**

### 1. **UNION**
- Combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set.
- Removes duplicate rows from the combined result.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_names
FROM table2;
```

---

### 2. **UNION ALL**
- Similar to `UNION`, but **does not remove duplicate rows**.
- Useful when you need all rows, including duplicates.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_names
FROM table2;
```

---

### 3. **INTERSECT** (MySQL 8.0.31+)
- Returns only the rows that are common to the result sets of both queries.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column_names
FROM table2;
```

---

### 4. **EXCEPT** (MySQL 8.0.31+)
- Returns rows from the first query that are not present in the second query.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column_names
FROM table2;
```

## **Using the World Database**

We will use the `Country`, `City`, and `CountryLanguage` tables from the **world** database to illustrate set operators.

### **Schema Overview**
1. **Country**: Contains information about countries.
   - Columns: `Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`
2. **City**: Contains information about cities.
   - Columns: `ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`
3. **CountryLanguage**: Contains information about languages spoken in each country.
   - Columns: `CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`

## **Examples**

### 1. **UNION Example**
Find all country and city names (without duplicates):
```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country
UNION
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM City;
```

---

### 2. **UNION ALL Example**
Find all country and city names (including duplicates):
```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country
UNION ALL
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM City;
```

**Key Difference:**
`UNION ALL` will include duplicate names if a city and country share the same name.

---

### 3. **INTERSECT Example**
Find names that appear in both `Country` and `City` tables:
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Country
INTERSECT
SELECT Name
FROM City;
```

---

### 4. **EXCEPT Example**
Find country names that are not city names:
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Country
EXCEPT
SELECT Name
FROM City;
```

---

## **Use Cases with Conditions**

### 1. Combine Results with Different Conditions
Find large countries (population > 50 million) or large cities (population > 10 million):
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Country
WHERE Population > 50000000
UNION
SELECT Name
FROM City
WHERE Population > 10000000;
```

---

### 2. Compare Official Languages Across Regions
Find languages spoken officially in Asia but not in Europe:
```sql
SELECT Language
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE CountryCode IN (SELECT Code FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Asia')
INTERSECT
SELECT Language
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE CountryCode IN (SELECT Code FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe');
```

---

### 3. Find Distinct Cities in Specific Regions
Get all distinct cities in Asia and Africa:
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM City
WHERE CountryCode IN (SELECT Code FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Asia')
UNION
SELECT Name
FROM City
WHERE CountryCode IN (SELECT Code FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Africa');
```

---

## **Key Points to Remember**
1. The **number of columns** and their **data types** in all queries must match.
2. Use `UNION` when you want to eliminate duplicates and `UNION ALL` for performance and retaining duplicates.
3. Use `INTERSECT` and `EXCEPT` for advanced filtering (MySQL 8.0.31+).
4. Columns in the result set inherit the names from the first query unless explicitly renamed.

---

## **Performance Considerations**
1. **UNION** may be slower than `UNION ALL` due to duplicate removal.
2. Indexing can improve performance when using set operators on large datasets.
3. Use **EXPLAIN** to analyze the query plan and optimize complex queries involving set operators.

---

## **Conclusion**
Set operators in MySQL provide a powerful way to combine and filter result sets from multiple queries. By leveraging examples from the world database, we can see their real-world applications in data retrieval and manipulation.
