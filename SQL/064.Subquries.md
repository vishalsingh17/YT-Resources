# Subqueries in MySQL

## Introduction

A **subquery** (also known as an inner query or nested query) is a query within another query. Subqueries are used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query. They can be used in various SQL clauses, such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, and `HAVING`.

Subqueries are often used to perform complex queries that would otherwise require multiple steps. They help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

## Types of Subqueries in MySQL

There are three main types of subqueries in MySQL:
1. **Single-row subquery**: Returns a single row and a single column.
2. **Multiple-row subquery**: Returns multiple rows but a single column.
3. **Multiple-column subquery**: Returns multiple rows and multiple columns.
4. **Correlated subquery**: Refers to columns from the outer query.

## General Syntax

### 1. Single-Row Subquery
The syntax for a single-row subquery is:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

### 2. Multiple-Row Subquery
The syntax for a multiple-row subquery is:

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IN (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

### 3. Multiple-Column Subquery
The syntax for a multiple-column subquery is:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE (column1, column2) IN (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

### 4. Correlated Subquery
A correlated subquery uses values from the outer query in the subquery:

```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table_name outer_table
WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM another_table WHERE outer_table.column_name = another_table.column_name);
```

## Examples of Subqueries

### 1. Using Subquery in a `SELECT` Clause
Subqueries can be used to return a value in the `SELECT` clause.

#### Example: Get the name of employees whose salary is higher than the average salary.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM emp_details
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details);
```

In this example:
- The subquery `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details)` calculates the average salary of all employees.
- The main query retrieves employees whose salary is greater than the average.

---

### 2. Using Subquery in the `WHERE` Clause with `IN`
You can use a subquery with `IN` to filter rows based on values returned by the subquery.

#### Example: Get the details of employees who work in departments 10 and 20.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id
FROM emp_details
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_id IN (10, 20));
```

In this example:
- The subquery `(SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_id IN (10, 20))` returns the department IDs 10 and 20.
- The main query selects employees whose `department_id` matches either of these department IDs.

---

### 3. Using Subquery in the `FROM` Clause
A subquery can also be used in the `FROM` clause to treat the result as a derived table.

#### Example: Get the total salary for each department.

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary)
FROM (SELECT department_id, salary FROM emp_details) AS dept_salary
GROUP BY department_id;
```

In this example:
- The subquery `(SELECT department_id, salary FROM emp_details)` selects `department_id` and `salary` from `emp_details`.
- The main query groups the results by `department_id` and calculates the total salary for each department.

---

### 4. Using Subquery in the `HAVING` Clause
You can use a subquery in the `HAVING` clause to filter groups of records based on aggregate values.

#### Example: Get the departments with total salary greater than the average salary across all departments.

```sql
SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING SUM(salary) > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details);
```

In this example:
- The subquery `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details)` calculates the average salary of all employees.
- The `HAVING` clause filters departments where the total salary exceeds the average salary.

---

### 5. Correlated Subquery
A correlated subquery refers to a column from the outer query and is executed for each row of the outer query.

#### Example: Get employees who earn more than the average salary of their respective department.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
FROM emp_details e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details e2 WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id);
```

In this example:
- The subquery `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details e2 WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id)` calculates the average salary for each department.
- The outer query retrieves employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their respective department.

## Key Points

1. **Subqueries in the `SELECT` clause**: Used to return a value that can be used in the main query.
2. **Subqueries in the `WHERE` clause**: Useful for filtering data based on conditions defined by another query.
3. **Subqueries in the `FROM` clause**: Can be used to create a derived table that is used by the main query.
4. **Correlated subqueries**: These refer to the outer query and are executed for each row of the outer query.
5. **Performance**: Subqueries can be inefficient, especially when used in the `WHERE` clause. In some cases, they can be optimized using joins or other strategies.

## Common Errors with Subqueries

1. **Returning More Than One Row in a Single-Row Subquery**:
   If a subquery is expected to return a single row, but it returns multiple rows, it will result in an error.
   
   Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT first_name
   FROM emp_details
   WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM emp_details);
   ```
   If the subquery returns more than one value, the query will fail. To fix it, ensure the subquery returns only one value.

2. **Using a Subquery in the `IN` Clause with an Invalid Value**:
   When using `IN` with a subquery, ensure that the subquery returns valid values that can be compared with the column in the outer query.

## Conclusion

Subqueries in MySQL provide a powerful way to perform complex queries by nesting queries within one another. They can be used in the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `FROM`, and `HAVING` clauses, making them versatile for filtering, aggregating, and manipulating data. Understanding how to use subqueries efficiently can greatly improve the readability and performance of SQL queries.
