# AS Keyword in MySQL
The `AS keyword` in MySQL is used to assign an alias to a column or table. Aliases are temporary names that make the output of queries more readable or simplify the query writing process. The alias exists only for the duration of the query and does not change the actual column or table name in the database.

Syntax
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

- column_name: The original name of the column.
- alias_name: The temporary name you want to give to the column.

```sql
SELECT table_name.column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name AS alias_table_name;
```

- table_name: The original name of the table.
- alias_table_name: The temporary name for the table.

### Key Points:
- Column Alias: The alias is used to make column names more descriptive.
- Table Alias: Table aliases can simplify complex queries, especially when using joins.
- No Impact on Database: Aliases are only for the duration of the query and do not modify the structure of the database.
- AS is Optional: You can assign aliases without explicitly using AS in MySQL. However, using AS improves code readability.

### Examples of AS Keyword with Different Conditions

#### 1. Using AS for Column Alias
Example: Retrieve employee first and last names with aliases.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME AS 'First Name', LAST_NAME AS 'Last Name'
FROM emp_details;
```

Explanation: The FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME columns are given more readable names 'First Name' and 'Last Name' in the result set.

#### 2. Using AS for Table Alias
Example: Retrieve employee details using a table alias.

```sql
SELECT e.EMPLOYEE_ID, e.FIRST_NAME, e.LAST_NAME
FROM emp_details AS e;
```

Explanation: The emp_details table is given an alias e, which simplifies the query by shortening references to the table.

#### 3. Combining Column and Table Aliases
Example: Retrieve employee details with both column and table aliases.

```sql
SELECT e.FIRST_NAME AS 'First', e.LAST_NAME AS 'Last', e.SALARY AS 'Income'
FROM emp_details AS e;
```

Explanation: Both column aliases ('First', 'Last', 'Income') and a table alias (e) are used to make the query more readable.

#### 4. Using AS with Calculated Columns
Example: Retrieve employee salary with tax applied and give the column an alias.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, (SALARY * 0.9) AS 'Salary After Tax'
FROM emp_details;
```

Explanation: The query calculates the salary after a 10% tax deduction and assigns the alias 'Salary After Tax' to the calculated column.


#### 5. Alias without AS (Optional)
Example: Assign alias without explicitly using the AS keyword.

```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME 'First', LAST_NAME 'Last'
FROM emp_details;
```

Explanation: In MySQL, you can skip the AS keyword when assigning an alias, but for clarity and consistency, it is generally recommended to include it.

#### 6. Alias in GROUP BY and ORDER BY
Example: Using aliases in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.

```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID AS 'Dept', COUNT(*) AS 'Employee Count'
FROM emp_details
GROUP BY 'Dept'
ORDER BY 'Employee Count' DESC;
```

Explanation: Aliases can also be used in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to improve readability.

### Key Takeaways:
- The AS keyword is used to assign aliases for columns and tables.
- Aliases are useful for making complex queries easier to read and understand.
- You can alias calculated columns and use aliases in GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.
- The AS keyword is optional but recommended for clarity.
