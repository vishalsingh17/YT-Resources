# **INTERSECT Operators in MySQL**

## **Introduction**
MySQL does not natively support the `INTERSECT` operator, which is commonly used in other database systems to return the common rows between two `SELECT` queries. However, you can simulate the `INTERSECT` functionality in MySQL using `INNER JOIN` or `WHERE EXISTS` subqueries.

In this guide, we will explain how to simulate the `INTERSECT` operator in MySQL, using examples from the `world` database.

## **What is the INTERSECT Operator?**
The `INTERSECT` operator returns the common rows from two `SELECT` queries. It combines the results of both queries and only returns rows that appear in both result sets.

### **Key Points**
- It returns only the rows that exist in both result sets.
- The number of columns and their data types must be the same in both queries.
- Duplicate rows are automatically eliminated in the result.

Since MySQL does not support the `INTERSECT` operator directly, we can simulate it by using `INNER JOIN` or a combination of `WHERE EXISTS` and `IN` subqueries.

## **Simulating INTERSECT Using INNER JOIN**
To simulate the `INTERSECT` operator using `INNER JOIN`, we combine two `SELECT` queries that share common columns.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### **Example 1: INTERSECT Using INNER JOIN**
Let’s say we want to find all cities that are both in the `Country` and `City` tables, based on their `Name`. Here’s how we can simulate the `INTERSECT` functionality using `INNER JOIN`.

```sql
SELECT c.Name AS Location
FROM Country co
INNER JOIN City c ON co.Name = c.Name;
```
**Explanation**: 
- We are performing an `INNER JOIN` on the `Country` and `City` tables, where the `Name` field matches in both tables. 
- The query returns cities that are common between the `Country` and `City` tables.

## **Simulating INTERSECT Using WHERE EXISTS**
Another way to simulate the `INTERSECT` operator is by using a subquery with the `WHERE EXISTS` clause. This method checks if a row from the first `SELECT` query also exists in the second `SELECT` query.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM table2
    WHERE table1.column = table2.column
);
```

### **Example 2: INTERSECT Using WHERE EXISTS**
Let’s find the common countries and cities that share the same name, using the `WHERE EXISTS` subquery.

```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country co
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM City c
    WHERE c.Name = co.Name
);
```
**Explanation**:
- This query returns all country names from the `Country` table that also exist in the `City` table by checking if a matching `Name` is present in the `City` table.
- The `WHERE EXISTS` subquery returns a result for each country if a matching city exists.

---

## **Simulating INTERSECT Using IN**
We can also use the `IN` operator to simulate the `INTERSECT` functionality. The `IN` operator checks whether a value from the first `SELECT` query exists in the result of the second query.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (
    SELECT column1
    FROM table2
);
```

### **Example 3: INTERSECT Using IN**
Let’s use the `IN` operator to find cities that are both in the `Country` and `City` tables.

```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country
WHERE Name IN (
    SELECT Name
    FROM City
);
```
**Explanation**:
- This query finds cities that are present in both the `Country` and `City` tables, based on the `Name` column.
- It uses the `IN` operator to check if each country name in the `Country` table exists in the `City` table.

## **Comparison Between Methods**
| **Method**           | **Description**                                            | **Example Query**                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INNER JOIN**       | Joins two tables on a common column and returns matching rows | `SELECT c.Name AS Location FROM Country co INNER JOIN City c ON co.Name = c.Name;` |
| **WHERE EXISTS**     | Uses a subquery to check if a row exists in another query   | `SELECT Name AS Location FROM Country co WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM City c WHERE c.Name = co.Name);` |
| **IN**               | Uses a subquery to check if a value exists in another query | `SELECT Name AS Location FROM Country WHERE Name IN (SELECT Name FROM City);` |

## **Examples Using World Database**

### **Example 1: Find Common Countries and Cities with INNER JOIN**
Find countries and cities that share the same name:
```sql
SELECT c.Name AS Location
FROM Country co
INNER JOIN City c ON co.Name = c.Name;
```
**Explanation**: This query combines the `Country` and `City` tables based on the matching `Name` column and returns common locations.

### **Example 2: Find Common Countries and Cities with WHERE EXISTS**
```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country co
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM City c
    WHERE c.Name = co.Name
);
```
**Explanation**: This query returns the countries that share their name with a city in the `City` table.

### **Example 3: Find Common Countries and Cities with IN**
```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country
WHERE Name IN (
    SELECT Name
    FROM City
);
```
**Explanation**: This query returns countries that are also cities, based on the `Name` column.

## **Conclusion**
While MySQL does not directly support the `INTERSECT` operator, it is possible to simulate this functionality using `INNER JOIN`, `WHERE EXISTS`, or `IN` subqueries. Each method serves the same purpose of finding the common records between two result sets, with slight variations in implementation and performance.

- Use `INNER JOIN` when you need to combine two tables and return only matching rows.
- Use `WHERE EXISTS` and `IN` when you want to filter rows in one table based on the existence of matching rows in another table.

Understanding these techniques will allow you to perform `INTERSECT`-like operations in MySQL effectively.
