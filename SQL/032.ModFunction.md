# MySQL `MOD()` Function

The `MOD()` function in MySQL calculates the remainder of a division operation. It is commonly used for operations where we need to know if a number is divisible by another, or to cycle through values in a pattern.

## 1. Syntax

```sql
MOD(N, M)
```

- **N**: The dividend (number to be divided).
- **M**: The divisor.

The function returns the remainder when `N` is divided by `M`.

### Note:
`MOD()` behaves similarly to the `%` operator in MySQL for finding remainders.

## 2. Examples Using `MOD()`

Let's use the `emp_details` table to explore different conditions with the `MOD()` function.

### Example 1: Simple Remainder Calculation
Get the remainder of the `SALARY` column when divided by `1000`:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, SALARY, MOD(SALARY, 1000) AS remainder
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: This finds the remainder when the `SALARY` is divided by `1000`, showing what amount is left after grouping the salary by thousands.

### Example 2: Check Even or Odd Salaries
Identify employees with an even or odd `SALARY`:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME,
       MOD(SALARY, 2) AS even_or_odd_salary
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**:
- If the result of `MOD(SALARY, 2)` is `0`, the salary is even.
- If the result is `1`, the salary is odd.

**Purpose**: This example helps classify records into two categories based on even or odd values.

### Example 3: Divisibility Check for Specific Values
Find employees whose `SALARY` is divisible by `500`:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE MOD(SALARY, 500) = 0;
```

**Purpose**: By setting the remainder to `0`, this query returns rows where `SALARY` is a multiple of `500`.

### Example 4: Custom Cycle Calculation
Create a custom cycle for departments using the `DEPARTMENT_ID` with a range of `3` to categorize departments into `3` groups:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, DEPARTMENT_ID,
       MOD(DEPARTMENT_ID, 3) AS department_group
FROM emp_details;
```

**Purpose**: This assigns each `DEPARTMENT_ID` to one of three groups, which can be useful for balanced load distribution or rotational grouping.


### Example 5: Calculate Remainder for Salary Adjustments
Calculate any remainder after dividing `SALARY` by `1500` to help adjust salaries:

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, SALARY,
       MOD(SALARY, 1500) AS salary_remainder
FROM emp_details
WHERE MOD(SALARY, 1500) <> 0;
```

**Purpose**: Helps identify salaries that don't fit an ideal `1500` increment, which could aid in standardizing payroll adjustments.

These examples show how `MOD()` can be applied across various use cases, from even-odd checks to custom groupings and date cycles.
