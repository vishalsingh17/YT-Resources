# **LEFT JOIN in MySQL**

## **Introduction**
A **LEFT JOIN** in MySQL retrieves all records from the **left table** and the matching records from the **right table**. If there is no match in the right table, `NULL` values are returned for the right table's columns.

### **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM left_table
LEFT JOIN right_table
ON left_table.common_column = right_table.common_column;
```
- `left_table`: The main table from which all records will be retrieved.
- `right_table`: The table being joined, where matching records will be included.
- `ON`: Specifies the condition that links both tables.

## **Understanding LEFT JOIN with the `world` Database**
The `world` database contains three main tables:
1. **`Country`** â€“ Stores details about countries (`Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`, etc.).
2. **`City`** â€“ Stores details about cities (`ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`).
3. **`CountryLanguage`** â€“ Stores languages spoken in each country (`CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`).

We will use **LEFT JOIN** to explore relationships between these tables.

## **Example 1: Retrieve All Countries and Their Capital Cities**
This query retrieves all countries along with their capital city names. If a country does not have a registered capital city, the city name will be `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS CapitalCity
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN City
ON Country.Capital = City.ID;
```

### **Explanation**
- The `Country` table contains a `Capital` column that references the `ID` column in the `City` table.
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures that every country is listed, even if it does not have a capital city.

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName  | CapitalCity  |
|-------------|-------------|
| Afghanistan | Kabul       |
| Albania     | Tirana      |
| Andorra     | Andorra la Vella |
| Antarctica  | NULL        |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: Antarctica does not have a capital city, so the `CapitalCity` field is `NULL`.

---

## **Example 2: Retrieve All Countries and Their Official Languages**
This query retrieves all countries along with their official language. If a country does not have an official language in the database, it will show `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
AND CountryLanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';
```

### **Explanation**
- The `Country` table is joined with the `CountryLanguage` table on `CountryCode`.
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures all countries are listed, even if they do not have a recorded official language.

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName | Language |
|------------|----------|
| Afghanistan | Pashto   |
| Afghanistan | Dari     |
| Albania     | Albanian |
| Algeria     | NULL     |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: Algeria does not have an official language listed, so `NULL` appears.

---

## **Example 3: Find All Countries and Their Cities (Including Countries Without Cities)**
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS CityName
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN City
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**
- The `City` table has a `CountryCode` that links to the `Country` table.
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures that even countries without cities are included.

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName | CityName     |
|------------|-------------|
| Afghanistan | Kabul       |
| Afghanistan | Herat       |
| Albania     | Tirana      |
| Andorra     | NULL        |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: Andorra does not have a city listed, so `NULL` appears.

---

## **Example 4: Retrieve All Countries and Their GDP, Even If GDP Data is Missing**
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, Country.GNP AS GDP
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT CountryCode, GNP
    FROM Country
    WHERE GNP IS NOT NULL
) AS GDPData
ON Country.Code = GDPData.CountryCode;
```

### **Explanation**
- We are joining the `Country` table with a subquery that filters out `NULL` GNP values.
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures that countries without GDP data are still included.

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName | GDP       |
|------------|----------|
| Afghanistan | 5976.00  |
| Albania     | 4795.00  |
| Andorra     | NULL     |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: Andorra does not have GDP data, so `NULL` appears.

---

## **Example 5: Retrieve All Countries and Their Largest Cities**
This query lists all countries and their most populous city.

```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS LargestCity, MAX(City.Population) AS Population
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN City
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode
GROUP BY Country.Name;
```

### **Explanation**
- The **LEFT JOIN** ensures that all countries are included, even those without cities.
- `MAX(City.Population)` ensures that the largest city is selected.

### **Sample Output**
| CountryName | LargestCity | Population |
|------------|------------|------------|
| Afghanistan | Kabul      | 1780000    |
| Albania     | Tirana     | 374801     |
| Andorra     | NULL       | NULL       |

ðŸ”¹ **Observation**: Andorra does not have a city, so `NULL` appears.

## **Key Differences: INNER JOIN vs. LEFT JOIN**
| Feature         | INNER JOIN                         | LEFT JOIN                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Records from Left Table | Only matching rows are returned | All rows from the left table are returned |
| Records from Right Table | Only matching rows are returned | If no match, `NULL` values appear |
| Data Integrity | Filters data to only valid matches | Ensures all records from the left table are included |

## **Practice Questions**
Try writing SQL queries using the `world` database:

1. **Find all countries and their cities, ensuring that countries without cities are included.**
2. **Retrieve all countries and their GDP, ensuring that countries without GDP data are included.**
3. **Find all countries and their official and non-official languages, ensuring countries without languages are included.**
4. **List all continents and the total population of each continent, including continents with missing population data.**

---

## **Conclusion**
- The **LEFT JOIN** in MySQL ensures that all records from the **left table** are included, even if there are no matches in the **right table**.
- It is useful when you need to include all records from one table and display related data from another, while also handling missing relationships.
- The `world` database provides an excellent way to practice **LEFT JOINs**, especially with `Country`, `City`, and `CountryLanguage` tables.
