# **SELF JOIN in MySQL**  

## **Introduction**  
A **SELF JOIN** is a type of join where a table is joined with itself. This allows you to compare rows within the same table. Since MySQL does not have a direct `SELF JOIN` keyword, we use an **INNER JOIN** or **LEFT JOIN** where both sides of the join refer to the same table but with different aliases.  

### **Key Characteristics of SELF JOIN**  
‚úÖ It treats a single table as if it were two separate tables.  
‚úÖ It is useful for **hierarchical relationships** (e.g., employees and managers, neighboring cities, etc.).  
‚úÖ It requires **aliases** (`A` and `B`) to differentiate between the two instances of the table.  

---

## **Syntax of SELF JOIN**  
```sql
SELECT A.column1, B.column2
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B
ON A.common_column = B.common_column;
```
- `A` and `B` are **aliases** representing two instances of the same table.  
- The **ON** condition defines how the rows are related.  

---

## **Understanding SELF JOIN with the `world` Database**  
The `world` database contains three main tables:  
1. **`Country`** ‚Äì Stores country details (`Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`, etc.).  
2. **`City`** ‚Äì Stores city details (`ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`).  
3. **`CountryLanguage`** ‚Äì Stores languages spoken in each country (`CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`).  

We will use **SELF JOIN** to explore relationships within these tables.

## **Example 1: Find Countries in the Same Continent**  
This query retrieves pairs of countries that are in the same continent.  

```sql
SELECT A.Name AS Country1, B.Name AS Country2, A.Continent
FROM Country A
JOIN Country B
ON A.Continent = B.Continent
AND A.Code <> B.Code
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The `Country` table is joined with itself using aliases `A` and `B`.  
- The `ON` clause ensures that the two countries are in the **same continent**.  
- The condition `A.Code <> B.Code` prevents a country from being paired with itself.  
- The `LIMIT 10` restricts the output to avoid excessive results.  

### **Sample Output**  
| Country1      | Country2       | Continent  |
|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Afghanistan  | Albania       | Asia       |
| Afghanistan  | Algeria       | Asia       |
| Albania      | Afghanistan   | Europe     |

üîπ **Observation**: The table lists country pairs that belong to the same continent.

## **Example 2: Find Neighboring Countries in the Same Region**  
This query lists countries that are in the **same region** (e.g., South America, Western Europe).  

```sql
SELECT A.Name AS Country1, B.Name AS Country2, A.Region
FROM Country A
JOIN Country B
ON A.Region = B.Region
AND A.Code <> B.Code
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The `ON` clause ensures that the two countries share the same region.  
- The condition `A.Code <> B.Code` ensures that a country is not paired with itself.  

### **Sample Output**  
| Country1    | Country2   | Region            |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Argentina  | Brazil    | South America    |
| Argentina  | Chile     | South America    |
| France     | Germany   | Western Europe   |

üîπ **Observation**: The table lists country pairs in the same region.

## **Example 3: Find Cities in the Same Country**  
This query retrieves pairs of cities that belong to the same country.  

```sql
SELECT A.Name AS City1, B.Name AS City2, A.CountryCode
FROM City A
JOIN City B
ON A.CountryCode = B.CountryCode
AND A.ID <> B.ID
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The `ON` clause ensures that the two cities are in the **same country**.  
- The condition `A.ID <> B.ID` ensures that a city is not paired with itself.  

### **Sample Output**  
| City1        | City2      | CountryCode |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Kabul       | Herat     | AFG         |
| Buenos Aires | C√≥rdoba  | ARG         |
| Berlin      | Hamburg   | DEU         |

üîπ **Observation**: The table lists cities within the same country.

## **Example 4: Find Countries with Similar Populations**  
This query retrieves countries that have a **similar population size** (within a 10% difference).  

```sql
SELECT A.Name AS Country1, B.Name AS Country2, A.Population, B.Population
FROM Country A
JOIN Country B
ON ABS(A.Population - B.Population) <= (A.Population * 0.1)
AND A.Code <> B.Code
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The condition `ABS(A.Population - B.Population) <= (A.Population * 0.1)` ensures that countries have similar populations (within 10%).  
- The condition `A.Code <> B.Code` ensures that a country is not paired with itself.  

### **Sample Output**  
| Country1    | Country2    | Population1 | Population2 |
|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Albania    | Armenia    | 2877797     | 2897582     |
| Austria    | Switzerland | 8192880     | 8189300     |

üîπ **Observation**: The table lists countries with close population sizes.

## **Example 5: Find Countries Where Multiple Languages Are Spoken**  
This query retrieves countries that have **at least two different languages** spoken.  

```sql
SELECT A.CountryCode, A.Language AS Language1, B.Language AS Language2
FROM CountryLanguage A
JOIN CountryLanguage B
ON A.CountryCode = B.CountryCode
AND A.Language <> B.Language
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Explanation**  
- The `ON` clause ensures that both languages belong to the same country.  
- The condition `A.Language <> B.Language` ensures that two different languages are selected.  

### **Sample Output**  
| CountryCode | Language1 | Language2 |
|------------|----------|----------|
| AFG        | Pashto   | Dari     |
| ARG        | Spanish  | English  |

üîπ **Observation**: The table lists countries with multiple spoken languages.

## **When to Use SELF JOIN?**  
‚úÖ **Comparing rows within the same table** (e.g., cities in the same country, neighboring countries).  
‚úÖ **Finding hierarchical relationships** (e.g., managers and employees).  
‚úÖ **Identifying similar data** (e.g., countries with similar populations).  

---

## **When to Avoid SELF JOIN?**  
‚ùå **When dealing with large tables**, as it can produce excessive results.  
‚ùå **When a direct join with another table is more efficient**.

## **Comparison: INNER JOIN vs. SELF JOIN**  
| Feature          | INNER JOIN                        | SELF JOIN                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Number of Tables | Two or more                     | One (joined with itself)         |
| Use Case        | Relating different tables        | Comparing rows within the same table |

---

## **Practice Questions**  
Try writing SQL queries using the `world` database:  

1. **Find all country pairs that belong to the same continent.**  
2. **Retrieve city pairs that belong to the same country.**  
3. **Find countries with similar GDP (within a 5% difference).**  
4. **List countries where at least two different languages are spoken.**  

---

## **Conclusion**  
- A **SELF JOIN** joins a table with itself to compare rows within the same dataset.  
- It is useful for analyzing **hierarchical relationships**, **similarities**, and **pairwise comparisons**.  
- The `world` database provides a great way to practice **SELF JOIN**, especially with `Country`, `City`, and `CountryLanguage` tables.
