# Joins in MySQL

## Introduction to Joins
In MySQL, **joins** are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. The `world` database contains tables such as `Country`, `City`, and `CountryLanguage` that are often used for join operations.

## Types of Joins in MySQL
1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table. Non-matching rows in the right table are filled with `NULL`.
3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table. Non-matching rows in the left table are filled with `NULL`.
4. **FULL JOIN** (not natively supported in MySQL but simulated using `UNION`): Combines results of both `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.
5. **CROSS JOIN**: Produces the Cartesian product of two tables.
6. **SELF JOIN**: A table is joined with itself.

## Example Tables in the `world` Database
- **`Country`**: Contains country information (`Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`, etc.).
- **`City`**: Contains city information (`ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`).
- **`CountryLanguage`**: Contains languages spoken in each country (`CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`).

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns rows with matching values in both tables.

**Example**: Get all cities and their respective countries.
```sql
SELECT City.Name AS CityName, Country.Name AS CountryName
FROM City
INNER JOIN Country
ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code;
```

**Result**:
| CityName       | CountryName     |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Kabul          | Afghanistan     |
| Qandahar       | Afghanistan     |
| Buenos Aires   | Argentina       |

---

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from the left table, along with matching rows from the right table. Unmatched rows will have `NULL` for right table columns.

**Example**: Get all countries and their official languages (if any).
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language, CountryLanguage.IsOfficial
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
AND CountryLanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';
```

**Result**:
| CountryName   | Language   | IsOfficial |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Afghanistan   | Pashto     | T          |
| Afghanistan   | Dari       | T          |
| Albania       | Albanian   | T          |
| Algeria       | NULL       | NULL       |

---

### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all rows from the right table, along with matching rows from the left table. Unmatched rows will have `NULL` for left table columns.

**Example**: Get all languages and their respective countries.
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language
FROM Country
RIGHT JOIN CountryLanguage
ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode;
```

**Result**:
| CountryName   | Language   |
|---------------|------------|
| Afghanistan   | Pashto     |
| Afghanistan   | Dari       |
| NULL          | Klingon    |

---

### 4. FULL JOIN
Combines results of both `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. MySQL does not natively support `FULL JOIN`, but it can be simulated using `UNION`.

**Example**: Get all countries and their respective cities, including unmatched rows.
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS CityName
FROM Country
LEFT JOIN City
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode
UNION
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, City.Name AS CityName
FROM City
RIGHT JOIN Country
ON Country.Code = City.CountryCode;
```

---

### 5. CROSS JOIN
Returns the Cartesian product of two tables.

**Example**: Get all possible combinations of countries and languages.
```sql
SELECT Country.Name AS CountryName, CountryLanguage.Language
FROM Country
CROSS JOIN CountryLanguage;
```

**Result**: Produces a large dataset containing all possible combinations.

---

### 6. SELF JOIN
A table is joined with itself. Useful for hierarchical or comparative data.

**Example**: Find pairs of countries in the same region.
```sql
SELECT A.Name AS Country1, B.Name AS Country2, A.Region
FROM Country A
INNER JOIN Country B
ON A.Region = B.Region AND A.Code != B.Code;
```

**Result**:
| Country1     | Country2       | Region      |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Afghanistan  | Albania        | SouthernAsia|
| Albania      | Afghanistan    | SouthernAsia|

## Key Points
1. Use **INNER JOIN** to retrieve rows that match in both tables.
2. Use **LEFT JOIN** to keep all rows from the left table, even if thereâ€™s no match in the right table.
3. Use **RIGHT JOIN** for the reverse of `LEFT JOIN`.
4. Simulate **FULL JOIN** using `UNION`.
5. Use **CROSS JOIN** cautiously as it can produce large result sets.
6. **SELF JOIN** is helpful for comparing rows within the same table.

### Practice Queries for `world` Database
1. **List all official languages for countries in Asia**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Country.Name, CountryLanguage.Language
   FROM Country
   INNER JOIN CountryLanguage
   ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
   WHERE Country.Continent = 'Asia' AND CountryLanguage.IsOfficial = 'T';
   ```

2. **List all cities and their respective countries, even if the city has no matching country**:
   ```sql
   SELECT City.Name AS CityName, Country.Name AS CountryName
   FROM City
   LEFT JOIN Country
   ON City.CountryCode = Country.Code;
   ```

3. **Find countries that do not have any official languages**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Country.Name
   FROM Country
   LEFT JOIN CountryLanguage
   ON Country.Code = CountryLanguage.CountryCode
   WHERE CountryLanguage.IsOfficial IS NULL;
   ```

## Conclusion
Joins in MySQL are powerful tools for combining and analyzing data from multiple tables. By using the `world` database as a reference, you can understand and practice various types of joins to solve real-world problems effectively.
