# `CONCAT()` Function in MySQL

The `CONCAT()` function in MySQL is used to combine two or more strings into a single string. It takes multiple string arguments and returns a single concatenated string.

## Syntax

```sql
CONCAT(string1, string2, ... , stringN)
```

- **string1, string2, ..., stringN**: Strings or column values to concatenate.

### Key Points
- The function ignores `NULL` values in any of the arguments.
- It returns a single string as output.
- Can be combined with other functions for more complex operations.

## Examples Using `emp_details` Table

### Example 1: Concatenate First and Last Names
Concatenate the first name and last name of employees.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, ' ', LAST_NAME) AS FULL_NAME
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**: Concatenates `FIRST_NAME` and `LAST_NAME` with a space between them.

### Example 2: Concatenate with Additional Text
Concatenate `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME`, and a custom string.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, ' ', LAST_NAME, ' is an employee.') AS DESCRIPTION
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**: Adds "is an employee." to each full name.

### Example 3: Using CONCAT() with `WHERE` Clause
Retrieve full names of employees in department 50.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, ' ', LAST_NAME) AS FULL_NAME
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 50;
```

**Explanation**: Filters for employees in department 50.

### Example 4: CONCAT() with Multiple Columns
Combine `FIRST_NAME`, `LAST_NAME`, and `JOB_ID` to provide a brief employee description.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, ' ', LAST_NAME, ' - ', JOB_ID) AS EMPLOYEE_DETAILS
FROM emp_details;
```

**Explanation**: Creates a description with job ID.

### Example 5: CONCAT() with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
Retrieve and order employee names by salary, and limit results.

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(FIRST_NAME, ' ', LAST_NAME) AS FULL_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
ORDER BY SALARY DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Explanation**: Orders by salary and limits to top 5 highest-paid employees.

## Additional Notes
- `CONCAT()` is widely used for creating readable strings from multiple columns.
- Useful for data formatting and report generation.
