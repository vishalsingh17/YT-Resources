The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter records that meet certain conditions. It is typically used in SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. Hereâ€™s a basic overview:
#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
#### Suppose you have a table called emp_details and you want to select employees who have DEPARTMENT_ID = 50:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM emp_details
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 50;
```

In the above query we are using "Equal To" operator. Moving forward we will many more operators.

#### Select employee having emp_id = 200
```sql
SELECT *
FROM emp_details
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 200;
```
#### Select employee having emp_id = 250 (which doesn't exist)
```sql
SELECT *
FROM emp_details
WHERE EMPLOYEE_ID = 250;
```
 #### Select employee having FIRST_NAME="Donald"
```sql
SELECT *
FROM emp_details
WHERE FIRST_NAME="Donald";
```

#### Select employee' EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY having FIRST_NAME="Donald"
```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, SALARY
FROM emp_details
WHERE FIRST_NAME="Donald";
```
