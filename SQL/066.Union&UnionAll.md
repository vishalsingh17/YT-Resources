# **UNION & UNION ALL Operators in MySQL**

## **Introduction**
The `UNION` operator in MySQL is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows by default and is particularly useful for merging data from different tables or queries.

---

## **Types of UNION Operators in MySQL**
MySQL supports two types of `UNION` operators:
1. **UNION**: Combines the result sets and eliminates duplicate rows.
2. **UNION ALL**: Combines the result sets without removing duplicates, thus including all rows.

---

## **Key Rules for Using UNION Operators**
1. Each `SELECT` query in the `UNION` must have the **same number of columns**.
2. The **data types** of the columns in the `SELECT` queries must be compatible.
3. The column names in the result set are derived from the first `SELECT` query.

---

## **Syntax**

### **UNION**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

### **UNION ALL**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

## **Using UNION with the World Database**

### **Schema Overview**
- **Country**: Contains information about countries.
  - Columns: `Code`, `Name`, `Continent`, `Region`, `Population`
- **City**: Contains information about cities.
  - Columns: `ID`, `Name`, `CountryCode`, `Population`
- **CountryLanguage**: Contains information about languages spoken in each country.
  - Columns: `CountryCode`, `Language`, `IsOfficial`, `Percentage`

## **Examples**

### **Example 1: Combine Country and City Names**
Retrieve the names of all countries and cities (no duplicates).
```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country
UNION
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM City;
```

**Result:**
This query returns a single list of unique country and city names.

---

### **Example 2: Combine Country and City Names with Duplicates**
Retrieve the names of all countries and cities, including duplicates.
```sql
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM Country
UNION ALL
SELECT Name AS Location
FROM City;
```

**Result:**
This query includes duplicates if a country and city share the same name.

---

### **Example 3: Filtered Union**
Retrieve the names of countries with populations over 50 million and cities with populations over 10 million.
```sql
SELECT Name
FROM Country
WHERE Population > 50000000
UNION
SELECT Name
FROM City
WHERE Population > 10000000;
```

**Result:**
This query combines results from two filtered sets of data.

---

### **Example 4: Union with Additional Columns**
Retrieve the names and populations of countries and cities:
```sql
SELECT Name, Population
FROM Country
UNION
SELECT Name, Population
FROM City;
```

**Note:** If a column is missing in one query, ensure the data types and positions match.

---

### **Example 5: Add Labels to Columns**
Include labels to differentiate results:
```sql
SELECT Name, 'Country' AS Type
FROM Country
UNION
SELECT Name, 'City' AS Type
FROM City;
```

**Result:**
This query adds a "Type" column to identify whether the name is a country or a city.

---

### **Example 6: Combine Languages with Official Languages**
Retrieve all languages spoken in the world, prioritizing official languages:
```sql
SELECT Language
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE IsOfficial = 'T'
UNION
SELECT Language
FROM CountryLanguage
WHERE IsOfficial = 'F';
```

**Result:**
This query returns a unique list of all languages.

---

## **Key Points to Remember**
1. **Column Count and Data Types**: Ensure that the number of columns and their data types match across all queries in the `UNION`.
2. **Performance**: 
   - `UNION ALL` is faster than `UNION` because it doesn't remove duplicates.
   - Use `UNION` only when duplicates need to be eliminated.
3. **Order of Operations**: 
   - Use `ORDER BY` after the final `UNION` to sort the combined result.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT Name
     FROM Country
     UNION
     SELECT Name
     FROM City
     ORDER BY Name;
     ```

---

## **Practical Applications**
1. **Data Integration**: Combine data from multiple tables into a single result set.
2. **Reporting**: Merge results for business analytics or reporting.
3. **Data Deduplication**: Eliminate duplicates from combined data sources.

---

## **Performance Considerations**
- Use **`UNION ALL`** when duplicates are not a concern, as it avoids the overhead of duplicate removal.
- Indexing can improve the performance of individual queries in the `UNION`.

---

## **Conclusion**
The `UNION` and `UNION ALL` operators in MySQL provide powerful tools for combining results from multiple queries. By leveraging the flexibility of these operators with the `world` database, you can merge, filter, and analyze data effectively.
