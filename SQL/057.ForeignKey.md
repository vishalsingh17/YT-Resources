# Detailed Notes on Foreign Key in MySQL

## Introduction
A **foreign key** in MySQL is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table. It creates a relationship between two tables and ensures referential integrity.

---

## Key Features of Foreign Keys
- A foreign key establishes a link between the **child table** and the **parent table**.
- It enforces referential integrity by ensuring that the values in the child table match those in the parent table.
- MySQL supports actions such as `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` to handle changes in the parent table.

---

## Syntax
Foreign keys can be added during table creation or to an existing table.

### 1. Adding a Foreign Key During Table Creation
```sql
CREATE TABLE child_table (
    column_name data_type,
    FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES parent_table(parent_column)
    ON DELETE action
    ON UPDATE action
);
```

### 2. Adding a Foreign Key to an Existing Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE child_table
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_name
FOREIGN KEY (column_name)
REFERENCES parent_table(parent_column)
ON DELETE action
ON UPDATE action;
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Foreign Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```
In this example:
- `employees.department_id` is the foreign key referencing `departments.department_id`.
- An employee must belong to an existing department.

### Inserting Data
```sql
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES (1, 'HR'), (2, 'IT');

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id)
VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe', 1); -- Valid

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id)
VALUES (102, 'Jane', 'Smith', 3); -- Error: No department with ID 3.
```

---

### Example 2: Foreign Key with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50)
);

ALTER TABLE orders
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_customer
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```
- If a customer is deleted from the `customers` table, all their orders in the `orders` table are automatically deleted.

### Deleting Data
```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;
-- Automatically deletes all orders with customer_id = 1.
```

---

### Example 3: Foreign Key with `ON UPDATE CASCADE`
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
    ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```
- If the primary key in the `products` table is updated, all matching rows in the `order_items` table are automatically updated.

### Updating Data
```sql
UPDATE products SET product_id = 10 WHERE product_id = 1;
-- Automatically updates product_id in order_items where product_id = 1.
```

---

### Example 4: Composite Foreign Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE classes (
    class_id INT,
    subject_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (class_id, subject_id)
);

CREATE TABLE students_classes (
    student_id INT,
    class_id INT,
    subject_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (class_id, subject_id) REFERENCES classes(class_id, subject_id)
);
```
In this example:
- The `students_classes` table references the composite key `class_id, subject_id` from the `classes` table.

---

### Example 5: Verifying Foreign Keys
Use `DESC` or `SHOW CREATE TABLE` to verify foreign keys:
```sql
DESC employees;
```

To view foreign key constraints:
```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE employees;
```

## Actions on `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE`

| Action         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CASCADE`      | Automatically delete or update matching rows in the child table.           |
| `SET NULL`     | Set the foreign key column in the child table to `NULL`.                   |
| `RESTRICT`     | Prevent deletion or update in the parent table if rows exist in the child. |
| `NO ACTION`    | Similar to `RESTRICT`, but deferred checks (not used in MySQL).            |

---

### Example 6: Using `ON DELETE SET NULL`
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE SET NULL
);
```
If a customer is deleted, their `customer_id` in the `orders` table is set to `NULL`.

---

### Common Errors and Solutions

1. **Error: Cannot add foreign key constraint**
   - Ensure data types of the foreign key and referenced column match.
   - Ensure the referenced column is indexed (e.g., primary key).

2. **Error: Cannot delete or update parent row**
   - This occurs when child rows exist, and the action is not defined as `CASCADE` or `SET NULL`.

---

## Conclusion
The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is essential for maintaining relationships and enforcing referential integrity in MySQL. By using actions like `CASCADE` and `SET NULL`, you can control how changes in the parent table affect child tables, making your database more robust and consistent.
