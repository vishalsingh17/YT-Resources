# `CHECK` Constraint in MySQL

## Introduction
The `CHECK` constraint in MySQL is used to limit the values that can be inserted into a column based on a condition. It ensures that only valid data is entered into the table by checking the values before insertion or update. If a value violates the condition set by the `CHECK` constraint, the operation will fail.

## Key Features of `CHECK` Constraint
1. **Enforcing Business Rules**: Helps ensure data integrity by enforcing business logic directly in the database.
2. **Validation at Insert/Update**: It validates data whenever an insert or update operation is performed.
3. **Multiple Column Validation**: You can apply the `CHECK` constraint across one or more columns to enforce complex conditions.
4. **Automatic Enforcement**: The database engine enforces the condition automatically.

## Syntax

### 1. Creating a Table with a `CHECK` Constraint
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name data_type CHECK (condition),
    other_column data_type
);
```
2. Adding CHECK Constraint to an Existing Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK (condition);
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Simple CHECK Constraint
We can enforce a CHECK constraint to ensure that a column like salary cannot have a negative value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (salary > 0)
);
```
In this example, any attempt to insert a negative value into the salary column will fail.

### Example 2: Value Range Using CHECK
We can enforce that the age of a person is between 18 and 60.

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT CHECK (age BETWEEN 18 AND 60)
);
```
This ensures that age must be between 18 and 60, inclusive.

### Example 3: Multiple Conditions with CHECK
You can use multiple conditions to enforce more complex business logic. For example, we want to ensure that the discount value cannot exceed the price value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    discount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    CHECK (discount <= price)
);
```
In this example, the discount cannot exceed the price of the product.

### Example 4: Adding CHECK Constraint to an Existing Column
You can also add a CHECK constraint to an existing table. For example, we want to ensure that the hours_worked for an employee does not exceed 40 hours a week.

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_hours CHECK (hours_worked <= 40);
```
This will enforce that no employee can have more than 40 hours worked in a week.

### Example 5: CHECK with Multiple Columns
You can apply a CHECK constraint that involves more than one column. For example, ensuring that the end_date is always later than the start_date.

```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    CHECK (end_date > start_date)
);
```
This ensures that end_date is always later than start_date.

## Verifying CHECK Constraints
To verify the CHECK constraints in your table, you can use the SHOW CREATE TABLE command:

```sql
SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name;
```

This will display the table schema along with any CHECK constraints applied to the table.

## Limitations of CHECK Constraint in MySQL
- Versions Prior to MySQL 8.0.16: In older versions of MySQL, the CHECK constraint was parsed but ignored. It was only available for validation in the syntax but had no effect.
- Complex Conditions: The condition defined in the CHECK constraint must evaluate to a boolean value (TRUE or FALSE). For more complex conditions, you may need to use triggers.
- No Support for Foreign Key References: CHECK constraints cannot refer to other tables, unlike foreign key constraints.

## Key Points to Remember
- The CHECK constraint is a powerful tool for maintaining data integrity by enforcing business rules in the database.
- It can be used to validate data at the column level or across multiple columns.
- Always test your CHECK constraints to ensure they work as expected, especially when using MySQL versions prior to 8.0.16.
- You can combine `CHECK` constraints with other constraints like `NOT NULL`,` UNIQUE`, and `PRIMARY KEY` to further enforce data integrity.

## Conclusion
The `CHECK` constraint in MySQL provides an effective way to enforce data validation rules directly in the database schema. By ensuring that only valid data is entered into your tables, it helps maintain consistency and integrity throughout your application.
