# **MySQL `CURRENT_TIME()` Function**

The `CURRENT_TIME()` function in MySQL retrieves the current time without the date component. It is typically used when you only need the time part for comparisons, inserts, or other time-sensitive operations.

---

## **Syntax**
```sql
CURRENT_TIME()
```
or
```sql
CURRENT_TIME
```

- The function does not require parentheses, but including them is allowed.
- Returns the current time in the format **`HH:MM:SS`**.

---

## **Key Features**
1. **No Date Component:** Unlike `NOW()`, it returns only the time portion.
2. **Precise to the Second:** Provides time values up to seconds by default, but fractional seconds can be included with configuration.
3. **Consistent Output:** Within a single query execution, `CURRENT_TIME()` ensures consistent time results.

---

## **Examples with Different Conditions**

### **1. Retrieving the Current Time**
```sql
SELECT CURRENT_TIME() AS CurrentTime;
```
**Output:**  
`15:42:30`

---

### **2. Formatting `CURRENT_TIME()` Output**

#### Example: Extracting Only Hours
```sql
SELECT HOUR(CURRENT_TIME()) AS CurrentHour;
```
**Output:**  
`15`

#### Example: Extracting Minutes
```sql
SELECT MINUTE(CURRENT_TIME()) AS CurrentMinute;
```
**Output:**  
`42`

---

### **3. Inserting Current Time**

#### Example: Logging Current Time in a Table
```sql
INSERT INTO logs (event, event_time)
VALUES ('User logged in', CURRENT_TIME());
```

---

### **4. Using `CURRENT_TIME()` in WHERE Conditions**

#### **Condition: Records Matching the Current Hour**
Retrieve rows where the event occurred in the current hour.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM emp_details
WHERE HOUR(LAST_CHECKIN) = HOUR(CURRENT_TIME());
```

#### **Condition: Records Before or After Specific Times**
Retrieve rows where events occurred before 12:00 PM or after 6:00 PM.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM emp_details
WHERE TIME(LAST_CHECKIN) < '12:00:00' OR TIME(LAST_CHECKIN) > '18:00:00';
```

---

### **5. Comparing `CURRENT_TIME()` with Specific Intervals**

#### Example: Records from the Last 10 Minutes
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM emp_details
WHERE TIME(LAST_CHECKIN) >= CURRENT_TIME() - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE;
```

#### Example: Scheduled Tasks in the Next Hour
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM tasks
WHERE TIME(scheduled_time) BETWEEN CURRENT_TIME() AND CURRENT_TIME() + INTERVAL 1 HOUR;
```

---

### **6. Combining `CURRENT_TIME()` with Other Functions**

#### Example: Calculate Time Difference
Calculate how long ago an event occurred in minutes.

```sql
SELECT TIMEDIFF(CURRENT_TIME(), TIME(LAST_CHECKIN)) AS TimeDifference
FROM emp_details;
```

#### Example: Add/Subtract Time
Add 30 minutes to the current time.

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_TIME() + INTERVAL 30 MINUTE AS NewTime;
```

---

### **7. Conditional Updates Using `CURRENT_TIME()`**

#### Example: Update Status Based on Time
Set a flag for employees who checked in within the last hour.

```sql
UPDATE emp_details
SET STATUS = 'Checked In'
WHERE TIME(LAST_CHECKIN) BETWEEN CURRENT_TIME() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR AND CURRENT_TIME();
```


---

## **Considerations**

1. **Precision:** By default, `CURRENT_TIME()` provides time up to seconds. For milliseconds or higher precision, configure fractional seconds support in MySQL.
2. **Time Zones:** The time is based on the server's time zone settings.
3. **Performance:** Avoid excessive use of functions in WHERE clauses for large datasets to maintain query performance.
